Biography
Biography
Andrew Hector came to Southampton as a postdoctoral research fellow first in complex fluorides and oxyfluorides, then in lithium battery cathode materials. He took up a Royal Society University Research Fellowship to study precursor routes to new metal nitride compositions and processing methods before joining the academic staff. Andrew is a member of the Electrochemistry research grouping, with interests linking materials synthesis and characterisation with electrochemical applications.
Externally Andrew is a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry and a member the International Society of Electrochemistry. He currently serves on the RSC Electrochemistry interest group committee as treasurer. He is an EPSRC College member and serves on the Royal Society Research Grants panel and the IRC Government of Ireland PG scholarships panel.
