Biography
Biography
Julia Sinclair is Professor of Addiction Psychiatry within Medicine at the University of Southampton and Honorary Consultant in Alcohol Liaison in the NHS.
We still think about alcohol like we thought about smoking 30 years ago – we need to change that
Professor Sinclair was appointed as Senior Lecturer in Psychiatry and Honorary Consultant in Addiction Psychiatry in 2007. Having graduated from St George's Hospital Medical School, London in 1994, she trained in Psychiatry in the Wessex region and at Oxford. In 2002 she was awarded an MRC Training Fellowship in Health Services Research, during which time she was awarded a distinction for an MSc in Health Services Research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (2004) and a D.Phil from Christ Church, Oxford (2006).
Professor Sinclair's primary research aim is to conduct clinically relevant research in the harms of alcohol use. Specifically, to investigate how biological, psychological and social mechanisms interact, and their impact on clinical outcomes in terms of prevention, engagement and response to treatment.
