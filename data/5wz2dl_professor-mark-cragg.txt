Biography
Biography
Mark Cragg graduated from Bath University in 1994 with a first class degree in Biochemistry following placements at Glaxo Wellcome and Northeastern University, Boston. He then undertook a PhD in Immunology and Immunochemistry in Cancer Sciences. Following his PhD, he was awarded a career track fellowship within the School of Medicine and subsequently obtained a prestigious fellowship with the Leukaemia Research Fund (now Blood Cancer UK), with a period of study in the world-class laboratory of Andreas Strasser at the Walter and Eliza Hall institute in Melbourne. He returned to the UK in 2007, to establish his own research group within Cancer Sciences as a member of the Antibody and Vaccine Group (AVG) based in the Centre for Cancer Immunology.
His research group is interested in two main areas - antibodies and small molecule inhibitors with the aim of understanding how these therapeutics function to delete tumour cells and how they might be augmented. Throughout the strategy undertaken by the group is highly translational with iterative cycling between in vitro experiments, appropriate in vivo model systems and primary clinical material.
