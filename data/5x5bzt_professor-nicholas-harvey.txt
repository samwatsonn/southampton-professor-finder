Biography
Nicholas Harvey trained in medicine at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and is Professor of Rheumatology and Clinical Epidemiology, and Deputy Director, at the MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Centre, University of Southampton, where he leads an MRC programme, using a lifecourse approach to the epidemiology, determinants and prevention of osteoporotic fractures. He is Chair of the International Osteoporosis Foundation Committee of Scientific Advisors; a Trustee of the UK Royal Osteoporosis Society (ROS) and Vice-Chair of the ROS Osteoporosis and Bone Research Academy. He has won national/international prizes, most recently the International Osteoporosis Foundation Medal of Achievement. He is an investigator on >£50m grant funding, has published >300 articles, and is a member of many national/ international committees, including as Musculoskeletal Lead for the UK Biobank Imaging Study, as a past member of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) Professional Practice Committee, and as clinical co-chair of the 2021 ASBMR Annual Meeting.
