Research interests
The demographic of populations worldwide is changing. People are living longer but with more years with affected by disability in the last two decades of life. The societal and economic consequences of this change are not being well managed. There is a lag in the development of health interventions and a need for rapid learning for future health and infrastructure planning. Typically, people in poorer economic situations are disproportionately affected by disability in later life.
Hearing loss and dementia: I lead multidisciplinary research focussed on hearing loss, the use of cochlear implants to restore hearing in otherwise deaf people and the interaction between hearing loss and dementia.
My focus is understanding cellular mechanisms in these conditions and also how the learning and methodologies used to investigate this can be applied across discipline boundaries. I am driving the implementation of data science methodologies for improved management of people who hear with cochlear implants and for the identification of early indicators of cognitive decline. I am championing the engagement of patients in research and as ambassadors to increase awareness of healthcare interventions amongst hard to reach and marginalised communities.

Nanomedicine: Drug efficacy is affected by the way the drug is delivered to its site of action. Packaging, at the nanoscale, within biocompatible polymers can increase efficacy, reduce off-target effects and enable delivery across biological barriers such as within the inner ear.
My research in collaboration with Nick Evans (Medicine), Seung Lee (Chemistry) and Adam Wheelan (DSTL) is to determine whether exisiting antimicrobials, repackaged within polymersomes, show improved efficacy against hard to treat persistent bacterial infections.

Biography
Biography
I am an interdisciplinary researcher committed to the engagement of patients and the public in research and in taking science beyond the expert.
My research focus is on biological factors, and the mechanisms, that affect progression of common conditions in older age. I have published over 60 scientific papers in leading multidiscplinary journals, collaborating with scientists and clinicians in both public and private sectors.
After my PhD studying the associations between aging and Alzheimer's disease I joined the CNS Inflammation group led by Prof Hugh Perry in the Centre for Biological Sciences. My work used in-vivo models to explore how inflammation outside the brain exacerbates brain injuries in Multiple Sclerosis, and the mechanisms that are initiated after acute injury.
With the support of an MRC Discipline Hopping Grant I started to work with Prof Hywel Morgan in Electronics and computer Science. I used micro and nanofabrication methods to develop devices for controlled growth of neurons in culture, funded by the NC3Rs. This sparked my interest and enabled me to see the value in working across traditional discipline boundaries. I led an EU grant (FP7) workpackage to develop the use of organic nanoparticles, polymersomes, for drug delivery working with Prof Paul Dalton (Wurtzburg, Germany). This work immersed me in the intricacies of the anatomy and function of the inner hear in hearing loss, and led to my current work on improving hearing outcomes after cochlear implantation.
In 2015 I led the programme revalidation and became the programme lead of the Masters in Medical Science. I am now Director of the Faculty Graduate School in Medicine. In this role I am using my education and research expertise to enhance the experience of post-graduate researchers and staff in the faculty.
