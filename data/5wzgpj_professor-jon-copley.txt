Biography
Biography
Jon has been involved in exploring the deep ocean over the past 25 years, including using Human-Occupied Vehicles (HOVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and leading expeditions aboard research ships. He took part in the first Human-Occupied Vehicle dive to the world's deepest known hydrothermal vents, becoming the first British person to dive more than 5000 metres deep in the ocean, and the first Human-Occupied Vehicle dives to reach 1000 metres deep in the Antarctic.
Jon is an Advisory Board member for the global Deep-Ocean Stewardship Initiative (DOSI) and a former Co-Chair of the InterRidge initiative for international cooperation in research at mid-ocean ridges. He is also a former Scientific Associate of the Natural History Museum in London and a National Geographic Explorer.
In science communication, Jon works with documentary-makers to share the exploration of the deep ocean with people worldwide, for example as a science advisor and onscreen contributor for BBC Blue Planet II. He routinely interacts with broadcasters and journalists to raise awareness of deep-sea issues and discoveries, and often talks about exploring the deep ocean at public events and festivals. He has also advised deep-sea eco-thriller and sci-fi series.
Jon is the author of Deep Sea: 10 Things You Should Know (Seven Dials, 2023) and Ask An Ocean Explorer (Hodder & Stoughton, 2019). He has published popular-science articles in outlets including The Guardian, Nature and New Scientist, where he was previously a Reporter and Assistant News Editor. Jon is a recipient of the Royal Society of Biology's Science Communication Award for Established Researchers and the British Science Association's Charles Lyell Award Lecture for Environmental Sciences.
Beyond his University role, in 2006 Jon co-founded SciConnect Ltd with colleagues in science journalism, creating a capacity-building company that has trained more than 15,000 scientists in how to share their work with wider audiences. Jon has worked as a Director of the company as it has developed training programmes for clients including research institutions, funding bodies, government agencies, NGOs and companies across the UK and in Europe.
