About
Professor Jayanta Sahu obtained his M.Sc (Physics) and PhD degrees from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT-Kharagpur), India. He then held a post-doc position at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Sweden, where he worked on the silica based planar waveguide (Silica-on-Silicon) devices, before joining the Optoelectronics Research Centre (ORC) in 2000, where he is currently a Professor and head of the Silica Fibre Fabrication Group (https://www.orc.soton.ac.uk/silica-fibre-fabrication).
Prof Sahu’s research focuses on optical materials, fibre lasers and amplifiers, and speciality optical fibre fabrication for telecommunications, fibre lasers and amplifiers, and sensing. At ORC, Prof Sahu has been involved in various pioneering research projects including the development of kW-class laser fibres, and next generation of telecomm fibres and amplifiers. His work has led to the demonstration of several world records in the field of high-power fibre lasers.
Prof Sahu has published over 400 articles in scientific journals and conferences in the area of optical fibre technology. He has been involved as a PI and Co-I in numerous research grants funded by the Research Councils UK, EU, industry, and government agencies.
