Biography
Biography
Juliet Gray completed undergraduate medical training at Queens' College, Cambridge, and the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine. After graduating, she undertook specialist training in paediatric oncology at Great Ormond Street, the Royal Marsden  and Southampton Children's hospitals. During her training she was awarded a Cancer Research UK Clinical Research Fellowship (2002-2006) and an NIHR Clinical Lectureship, which she undertook at the University of Southampton. This enabled her to compelte a PhD and post-doctoral training in cancer immunotherapy.
She was appointed as a Consultant in Paediatric Oncology at Southampton Children's Hospital in 2010, with a continued academic appointment at the University.  She has clinical and research expertise in neuroblastoma. She chairs the UK NCRI Neuroblastoma subgroup and the European research network (SIOPEN) Clinical Trials committe, and leads a number of international neuroblastoma trials.
