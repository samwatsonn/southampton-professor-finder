About
I'm a first-year PhD student in the Cyber-Physical Systems group. I am also the lab manager of CPS group.
I obtained a Master of Science degree in Microelectronics System Design from the University of Southampton in 2021 and a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2020.

Current research
I am working on POETS project (https://poets-project.org/). POETS project is based on event-driven computing for distriputed applications. Because of its unique architecture, when implementing large-scale applications, the wall-clock time will retain constent. I aim to design a new hardware framework based on POETS architecture to accelerate POETS applications.
