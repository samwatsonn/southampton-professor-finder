Biography
Biography
Dr Yanghee Kim is a Postdoctoral Career Track Research Fellow in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Southampton.
Her research is focused on developing biomaterials and harnessing their potential for tissue regeneration. She has worked on designs and chemical modification of scaffold/hydrogel and assessment of them by in vitro and in vivo studies, and published in journals such as Nature Communications, Biomaterials, Biofabrication, and Advanced Healthcare Materials.
During her PhD, she focused on enhancing macrophage recruitment to defects and modulating the macrophage phenotype by drug delivery to accelerate the tissue regeneration process.
She joined the Bone and Joint Research Group at the Centre for Human Development, Stem cells, and Regenerative Medicine in 2016 and focused on developing clay nanoparticles for stem cell-driven tissue regeneration funded by Dr Dawson’s EPSRC fellowship (Nanoclay group). She has also worked as a produce and process development scientist for the regenerative medicine spin-out company Renovos.
She is currently focused on modulating macrophage and stem cell responses to bioactive Nanoclay for bone regeneration in collaboration with Kyoto University, Japan, funded by MRC-AMED Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research Initiative grant.
