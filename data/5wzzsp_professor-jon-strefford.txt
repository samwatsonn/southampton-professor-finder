Biography
Biography
As a Professor of Cancer Genomics, and an Honorary NHS Clinical Scientist, my research is translational and spans genomic screening, diagnostic methods as well as molecular mechanisms. My focus is on the application of massively parallel sequencing approaches to dissect the human genome and its epigenetic regulation. We then exploit these findings to develop novel biomarkers that help predict the disease course in cancer patients.
"My lab aims to develop precision medicine approaches through harnessing our understanding of the human genome. Through the application of DNA sequencing technologies we continue to unmask genetic defects in genome of cancer patients, DNA lesions that can be used to transform the management of cancer patients, through more accurate prognostication and the development of targeted treatments."
After two years NHS training in clinical cytogenetics, Jon started his postgraduate education with a Ph.D. in Cancer Genetics and Genetic Toxicology at the University of Wales, Swansea, with a successful placement at Glaxo Wellcome. In 2000, he started his postdoctoral careers, working with Professor Bryan Young at the Cancer Research UK Medical Oncology Laboratory at St Bartholomew’s Hospital, London. In 2002, he received a Lectureship from Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London, prior to a move to the University of Southampton. In 2008, after four years working with Professor Christine Harrison, Jon was awarded a Personal Fellowship from Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research and a Senior Lectureship within the Faculty of Medicine.
His research focuses on the study of a number of mature B-cell neoplasm, in particular chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) and to a lesser extent follicular (FL) and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).. The research projects coordinated by Professor Strefford runs from biomarker discover, using a plethora of genomics approaches, to biomarker validation employing large international patient cohorts, to functional analysis, employing in vitro and in vivo model systems.
To facilitate these research objectives, Professor Strefford has attracted more than £25 million in grant funding from national and international research agencies and charities. He has spoken at international meetings such as the American Society of Hematology, the International Workshop on CLL and the American Association for Cancer Research.
Professor Strefford has extensive experience as a consultant for commercial companies, facilitating the development of FISH, microarray and sequencing products. He also has strong links with the pharmaceutical industry and acts as a consultant and contract research provider for a series of large international clinical trials
