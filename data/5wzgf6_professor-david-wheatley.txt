Biography
I completed my BSc in Archaeology at University College Cardiff in 1988 and came to Southampton to study for an MSc in Archaeological Computing which I completed in 1989. That was followed by a PhD that took me into the emerging field of Geographic Information Systems and their application to Archaeology, completed in 1993. I joined the academic staff in the Department of Archaeology in 1994.
