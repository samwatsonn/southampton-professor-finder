Biography
Alison is Clinical Professor of Cancer Nursing and End of Life Care at the University of Southampton and University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. She has a clinical academic appointment, which means she combines clinical practice and research. Her research focuses on understanding and responding to the needs of people affected by cancer and other life limiting illnesses. Alison was a member of the NIHR College of Senior Investigators between 2018-2022.
In October 2019 she became Director of NIHR ARC Wessex. Learn more here.
Alison is also Director of the Southampton Academy of Research (SoAR). SoAR supports the career development of Southampton's health-related research workforce, and works across the Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences and University Hospital Southampton.
In September 2020 Alison took up a secondment with NHS England and NHS Improvement for 2 days a week  in the role of Head of Nursing Research (Academic Leadership & Strategy)
