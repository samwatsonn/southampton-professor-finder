About
Dr. Massimiliano Guasoni received his doctorate in 2011 from the University of Brescia, Italy. Later he was appointed research associate at the University of Bourgogne, France (2012-2015) and then at the Australian National University (2016), funded through an Erasmus Mundus Fellowship.
He joined the ORC in 2016, where he is currently Principal Research Fellow (Associate Professor). He has been awarded a Marie-Curie Individual Fellowship in 2016 and an ERC Starting Grant in 2018 (project MODES) from the European Research Council. Starting from April 2020, he is the Principal Investigator of the project "Self-organized light in multicore optical fibers: a route to scalable high-power lasers and all-optical signal processing", funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).
His current research focuses on the design and fabrication of novel fiber optical amplifiers and miniaturized optical sources for telecommunication, medical and security applications.
Dr.Guasoni is currently leading the Multimode Photonics Group at the ORC.
