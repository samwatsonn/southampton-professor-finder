Biography
Biography
Dr Parwez Hossain is a King James IV Professor  & Associate Professor in Ophthalmology within Medicine at the University of Southampton and Consultant Ophthalmic Surgeon at University Hospitals Southampton. He works as a clinical scientist interested in cornea and ocular surface diseases.
His key work involves developing advanced management of corneal and ocular surface inflammatory conditions such as microbial keratitis and dry eye disease. His research has improved our understanding of the early stages of human corneal infection, especially with the early clinical course using imaging methods such as anterior segment OCT.
Parwez also has an active clinical and research interest in corneal transplantation, developing advanced techniques, including laser-assisted approaches for keratoplasty. He runs a highly successful surgical fellowship programme that trains surgeons in all aspects of corneal transplantation, including DSEK and DMEK.
Parwez qualified in Medicine from Aberdeen University and trained in Ophthalmology in Aberdeen, Nottingham, Leicester & Miami, USA. His clinician-scientist career started as Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Fellow at Aberdeen University. He studied for his PhD in Immunology and Biomedical Physics/Engineering to investigate the mechanisms of T-cell traffic in ocular inflammation. In his awarded PhD thesis, he established a novel method for in vivo tracking of immune cells in the retina and choroid., showing the early interactions of lymphocytes with an inflamed vascular endothelium.
