Biography
Brigitte Vollmer is Professor of Perinatal and Developmental  Neurology.
Brigitte Vollmer joined the University of Southampton in August 2010 as a Senior Lecturer in Paediatric Neurology with a special interest in perinatal neurology, neurodevelopment, and neuroimaging.
Having graduated from medical school at the Eberhard-Karls-University, Tuebingen, Germany, she trained as a Paediatrician and then as a Paediatric Neurologist at the Children´s Hospital, University of Tuebingen, Germany. Subsequently, she moved to the UCL Institute of Child Health/Great Ormond Street Hospital and University College London Hospitals, London, to receive clinical specialist and research training in neonatal neurology and in neurodevelomental follow-up of infants born at risk. Her PhD studies focused on neuroimaging investigations of brain structure –function relationships in preterm infants.
After having been awarded a Marie-Curie Fellowship she moved to Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, for postdoctoral studies, which were focused motor development and associations with brain structure as assessed with qualitative and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging methods in children with unilateral cerebral palsy and children born extremely preterm.
The focus of her current research is to investigate relationships between brain development and long term neurological and neurodevelopmental function in different groups of children who were born at high risk and/or have suffered adverse events in the peri/neonatal period that could result in brain damage of different degree.
Please see our research group webpage for more information: https://www.southampton.ac.uk/cndng/
Brigitte Vollmer is also Honorary Consultant in Neonatal and Paediatric Neurology at Suothampton Children's Hospital, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (UHS) ,and works closely with the neonatology team and the fetal medicine team at Princess Anne Hospital, UHS.
