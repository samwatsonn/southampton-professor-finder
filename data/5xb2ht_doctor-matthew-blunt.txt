Biography
Biography
Dr Blunt completed a PhD in immunology and pharmacology at the University of Bath, funded by the BBSRC and Novartis. His postdoctoral research focused on novel treatment strategies for haematological malignancies in the CRUK Centre in Southampton and then subsequently on natural killer cell activation against cancer with Professor Salim Khakoo.
His work has been published in prestigious journals including in Blood and Leukemia and he is also the recipient of numerous awards for research. These include the Catovsky prize from the UK CLL forum and the John Marsden Prize from the University of Southampton. To establish his laboratory, Matthew received the Postdoctoral Career Track Award from the University of Southampton and a John Goldman fellowship from Leukaemia UK in 2019. In 2023 he was selected as an 'Emerging Leader in Leukemia' by the Nature journal Leukemia.
Dr Blunt now leads a team of researchers investigating NK cell activation against cancer in collaboration with partners from academia and industry.
