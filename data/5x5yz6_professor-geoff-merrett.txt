Teaching
At Southampton, he leads and teaches on a number of well-received lecture, lab, and project based modules. In 2021, he was shortlisted for a Southampton University Student's Union award for Most Engaging Lecturer. He has a Postgraduate Certificate in Academic Practice, has supervised 125 UG/PGT project students, and continually seeks to improve his teaching. He led on the creation of a new MSc Internet of Things (IoT) degree programme at Southampton, uniquely designed to recruit students from both EEE and computing backgrounds. He has designed substantial educational material and delivered it to UG/PGT students, college teachers and students, and academic/industrial researchers. Internationally, he played a key role in the launch of the EEE degree at the University’s Malaysia campus, teaching there for two weeks every year from 2013-17. Having previously served as Senior Admissions Tutor for ECS' EEE degree programmes, Professor Merrett is currently Director of Outreach and Recruitment in the Department. In this role, he has overseen major projects for ECS’ public website, created ECS’ first outreach strategy, and led on a number of significant outreach projects (e.g. the ECS Summer Taster Courses, which were nominated for a VC Teaching Award in 2017, and the A-Level Electronic Engineering Teaching Kits, which received a VC Teaching Award in 2019).
Professor Merrett is External Examiner at the University of York for their MSc Embedded Wireless Systems and MSc Digital Systems Engineering degree programmes. He was General Chair of the 11th European Workshop on Microelectronics Education (EWME) in 2016, where he also published a paper on the use of innovative online lectures (for which he received funding from the National HESTEM Programme, and a VC Teaching Award in 2011). He now serves on the Workshop’s Steering Committee. He has been Branch Counsellor of the University’s IEEE Student Branch since 2010, and received the IEEE R8 ‘Outstanding Counsellor’ award in 2013. He has been Southampton’s academic representative for the UK Electronics Skills Foundation (UKESF) since 2011, a collaboration between industry and universities which, alongside promoting a career in electronics, provides scholarships, summer employment and industrial mentoring to undergraduates. In 2016 he was invited to join the UKESF’s Strategic Advisory Group, and helped to guide activities, took part in a roundtable discussion with government ministers on the engineering skills gap, and presented at their 5-year celebration event and the TechWorks Industry Summit 2018.
