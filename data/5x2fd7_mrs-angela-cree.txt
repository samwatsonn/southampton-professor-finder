Biography
Ms Angela Cree is Senior Research Manager Vision Sciences within Medicine at the University of Southampton.
Angela is Senior Research Manager in Vision Sciences within Clinical Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine based at University Hospital Southampton.She graduated in Biochemistry from the University of Sheffield and trained as a molecular biologist in the field of neurodegenerative disease:
Vision Science 2005-presentMolecular analysis of degenerative eye diseases: age-related macular degeneration (AMD), primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and rod cone degeneration.
Her current position in the Vision Sciences research team in Southampton supports basic science, in the integrated laboratory and clinical ophthalmic research program led by Professor Andrew Lotery.
Angela helped formulate their recent impact statement.
Multiple Sclerosis 1988-1994Molecular analysis of myelin protein genes, specifically the structure and chromosomal localization of the human 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) gene, and subsequent mutation screening in a multiple sclerosis cohort.
