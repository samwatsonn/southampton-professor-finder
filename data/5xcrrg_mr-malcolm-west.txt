Biography
Biography
Malcolm trained as an undergraduate at the University of Malta (MD, 2000-2005) before moving to the Northwest and Merseyside for foundation and core surgical training. He completed an NIHR-funded doctoral research programme in prehabilitation, exercise physiology, perioperative surgical risk stratification, and mitochondrial energetics with Professors Graham Kemp, Mike Grocott and Sandy Jack (PhD, 2011-2014) leading the first UK prehabilitation study in locally advanced rectal cancer patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy.
During his PhD Malcolm was the Clinical Lead for the Perioperative Cardio-Pulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) service at University Hospitals Aintree. He was then appointed as an NIHR academic clinical fellow in Wessex (NIHR ACF, 2014-2016) and subsequently an NIHR clinical lecturer (NIHR ACL, 2016-2020). He completed specialist training in surgery in August 2020 (FRCS 2019, FEBS 2023).
Malcolm has published extensively with significant high-impact papers published in prehabilitation and perioperative medicine. Malcolm was awarded the British Journal of Surgery, John Farndon Prize in 2015 and again in 2017 for his research in predicting surgical outcomes using CardioPulmonary Exercise Testing.
Malcolm is co-investigator of the WesFit – The Wessex Fit-4-Cancer Surgery (wesfit.org.uk) and SafeFit (safefit.nhs.uk) trials and is the chief investigator for the FrOGS study (>£5.2M). Malcolm is an NIHR GlobalSurg core member with an interest in global surgery and cancer outcomes in low to middle-income countries.
Malcolm was awarded the Royal College of Surgeons, England, Minimally Invasive and Maximally Invasive (MIMICC) fellowship in Complex and Robotic colorectal cancer surgery at St. Mark’s Hospital, London (2020-2021). He is currently the Association of Surgeons Great Britain and Ireland Moynihan Travelling Fellow for 2021-2022.
Malcolm was appointed as an associate professor in colorectal surgery and prehabilitation medicine in 2022. He is a complex cancer consultant surgeon, specialising in the treatment of colorectal cancer including primary, advanced, and recurrent cancers in particular pelvic cancers. He performs open and minimally invasive surgery, exenterative surgery (including sacrectomy), intraoperative radiotherapy (IOERT), and cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HiPEC).
He is currently the sub-speciality lead for the surgical research portfolio at the Clinical Research Network, Wessex and serves as the co-chair of the NIHR Research for Patient Benefit programme for southern England.
He has a keen interest in education and currently supervises PhD, MD, MMedSc and BMedSc students at the University of Southampton, where he is the MMedSc Deputy Module Lead for Research and the Southampton NIHR Clinical Academic Training Programme Lead.
