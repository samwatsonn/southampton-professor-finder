National allergy education: Prof Holloway leads the BSACI Allergy Education Network, exploring the current state of allergy education for the UK workforce. The first BSACI National Allergy Education Strategy was published in October 2021, and the Network is exploring implementation of the strategy, including research to create the evidence base for allergy education in the UK.
Allergy clinical service delivery and improvement: Through her supervision of MSc Allergy students undertaking their dissertation projects, Prof Holloway is involved in numerous projects around the UK and internationally which look at clinical service delivery and improvements in allergy care.

Biography
Biography
Professor  Judith Holloway is Professorial Fellow in Allergy within Medicine at the University of Southampton.
Prof Judith Holloway completed her doctorate with Professor Stephen Holgate at the University of Southampton in 1999 developing methods for the identification and isolation of dendritic cells from peripheral blood and their application to the study of high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) expression by dendritic cells in atopic asthma. Following this, Judith undertook postdoctoral studies of gestational immunology with Professor John Warner, investigating the development of the human immune system during pregnancy and the first year of life with emphasis on the role of dendritic cells in the immune system at this time and the increased prevalence of allergic disease. With Dr Englyst, her years of experience developing flow cytometry methods for identifying rare cells is now being used to innovate new machines and methodology to identify microvesicles which hold huge potential as biomarkers, as a way of detecting and following disease development and progression.
In 2007 Judith was appointed Lecturer in Allergy and Programme Leader of the MSc Allergy. Judith was awarded the Vice-Chancellor's Teaching Award in 2010 and 2018 for her work on the MSc Allergy programme. She became a Principal Fellow of the Higher Education Academy in 2014 and in 2017, her education in allergy was recognised by the internationally acclaimed award of National Teaching Fellow of the Higher Education Academy. Prof Holloway’s MSc Allergy course is recognised at national, European and worldwide levels, receiving endorsement from the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI), the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), accreditation from the Hong Kong Medical Council as the only quotable course in allergy and is part of Southampton Allergy Centre, a World Allergy Organisation (WAO) Centre of Excellence.
Judith is also a passionate leader, inspiring and supporting colleagues to enable them to deliver the best educational experience for students. She achieves this both within the Faculty in her role as Programme Lead and across the University through her work teaching and mentoring on the PG Cert Academic Practice and UKPSF PREP Framework.
