Biography
Biography
Trained as a theoretical physicist, Timothy Leighton researched in numerous fields, including oceanography, medicine, microbiology, chemistry, zoology, climate change and fluid dynamics. He pioneered the algorithms that predicted the sounds of Mars, Venus, Titan, and Jupiter, using these to outline the design requirements for the acoustic devices and missions that we are now seeing in development. Over 2-billion babies were born after ultrasonic scanning under the safety guidelines he co-authored. He invented the world’s first and second (and currently only) sonars capable of detecting mines in bubbly coastal waters; and then used that top develop radar for the detection of catastrophe victims, and improvised explosive devices. He invented technology used for monitoring safe conditions in the world's most powerful pulsed spallation neutron source ($1.3 billion) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States.
He was the first to release and explain how humpback whales use sound to hunt with bubble nets, and to explain how dolphins echolocate in bubbly seawater using nonlinear mathematics.
In medicine, he was Principal Investigator in the project that devised equations and methods for diagnosing and monitoring osteoporosis; and for the project that invented the Lithoscope for monitoring kidney stone therapy. He assisted the Institute of Cancer Research to develop technology for tumour therapy monitoring. He provided the underlying equations and experiments for the conical bubble and the needle-free injector, which has now treated over 1-million migraine sufferers. To combat v-CJD (‘mad cow disease’), he served on the Government of the United Kingdom's Working Group of the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies Sub-Group.
In terms of research aimed at the environment, he was Principal Investigator for the team that that revealed that the amount of carbon dioxide dissolving into the oceans was much greater than the values previously used in predicting climate change and ocean acidification, providing the first data from at-sea trials. He introduced the equations and method used to determine the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other ‘greenhouse’ gases from the seabed into the atmosphere, He developed the equations and method to detect and quantify leaks from undersea gas pipelines, and from disused oil wells in the seabed into which atmospheric carbon dioxide had been pumped to mitigate anthropogenic climate change.
He founded Global-NAMRIP in 2015 so that the scientific community, policymakers, public health and healthcare communities, could prepare for future ‘superbugs’ and pandemics. He founded HEFUA following his pioneering discovery that the public was being exposed, without their knowledge, to ultrasound in public places, and that a subset was suffering adverse effects (headaches, nausea, tinnitus etc.).
In addition to his university position, he is Executive General Director, a medical device manufacturer and R&D laboratory, that was founded on his patents to produce his inventions.
