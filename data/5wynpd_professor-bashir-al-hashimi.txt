About
Professor Bashir M. Al-Hashimi is a Visiting Professor in Electronics and Computer Science (ECS) at the University of Southampton and an ARM Professor of Computer Engineering at King's College London. He worked in the electronics design industry for eight years prior to embarking on an academic career with ECS in 1999, where he was awarded a personal Chair in 2004.
His research focuses on studying the interaction between hardware and software of energy-constrained computing to design systems that are more energy efficient and more reliable through theoretical and experimental advances. He has made contributions to the field of energy-efficient mobile computing systems, low-power test and test-data compression of digital integrated circuits and energy-harvesting computing. His research is supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). See here. In 2008, he founded the Arm-ECS industry-academia centre of research excellence in energy-efficient computing. He has supervised 40 PhD students to successful completion, published 380 referred technical papers, authored or co-authored 7 books and his recent edited book can be found here.
Bashir is an interdisciplinary researcher and he has led successfully a number of large-scale interdisciplinary research programmes funded by the EPSRC and industry. As examples, he was the principal investigator of an EPSRC Programme Grant PRiME as well as the Holistic project. Bashir has established numerous international research collaborations and he is currently a member of the EPSRC-funded international centre-to-centre research consortia in Spatial Computational Learning. He was awarded a CBE in 2018 for services to engineering and industry, was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2013 and as a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 2011a. He served on the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014 Electrical, Electronics and Materials Panel and will serve again in REF2021 as a member of the Engineering Panel.
Bashir is currently the Executive Dean of the Faculty of Natural & Mathematical Sciences at King’s College London and served previously at the University of Southampton as Executive Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences.
