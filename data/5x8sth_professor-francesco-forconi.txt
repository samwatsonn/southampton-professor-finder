Biography
Biography
Francesco Forconi (MD, DM, PhD, FRCPath) is a Professor of Haematology at the University of Southampton, UK.
He is the leader of the academic Cancer B-cell Group, comprising world-class scientists investigating the pathogenesis and clinical behaviour of lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). His most recent investigations have expanded towards the early detection of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and the cancer-specific post-translation modifications (oligomannose-type glycans) of the B-cell receptor of germinal center lymphomas and how to target therapeutically their interaction with microenvironmental lectins in follicular lymphoma.
His clinical activity is primarily dedicated to the care of patients with lymphomas and CLL, leading the CLL Service and a broad portfolio of interventional clinical trials.
Prof. Forconi is the UK lead of the international CRUK ECRIN-M3 consortium, investigating the early diagnosis of leukemias and lymphomas in close partnerships with European and international stakeholders. He has been a Member of the UK NCRI Haematological Oncology Clinical Studies Group and continues to be an active member of the UK NCRI CLL subgroup. He has served the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) for several technology appraisals for novel agents in clinical practice.
He is an active core member of the International Hairy Cell Leukemia Foundation, USA and leads Southampton as a “Center of Excellence” for Hairy Cell Leukaemia. He is Editorial Board Member for BLOOD and regularly contributes as a reviewer for the major journals of clinical and scientific immunology, oncology, and haematology; has chaired sessions at major international conferences including the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meetings, and has provided educational contributions at major haemato-oncology meetings including UK CLL forum, EHA, ASH, and ECCO/ESMO. He is currently the author of >150 peer-reviewed publications. His work has contributed to successful impact case studies (ICS) in the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014 and 2021 evaluations. He has collaborative scientific programs, funded by the main national and international Cancer and Haematology charities, on CLL and lymphoma.
