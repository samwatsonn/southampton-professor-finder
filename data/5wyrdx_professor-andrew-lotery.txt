Biography
Biography
Andrew Lotery is an ophthalmologist with major research interests in age-related macular degeneration, central serous chorio-retinopathy and inherited retinal diseases. He has been awarded the Nettleship Award for best research published by a UK ophthalmologist in the past 3 years by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and was listed by the Times as one of the United Kingdom’s top 100 doctors. He has been recognised for his research by the University Hospital Southampton Innovation and Researcher of the Year awards and a  Macular Society award. He was editor in chief of the scientific journal, Eye for 10 years and is past Chair of the Scientific Committee of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists. He has served two times as an NIHR Senior Investigator. His research has been funded by the Wellcome Trust, NIHR and eye research charities. He has served as Chair of several national eye research advisory boards for Sight Research UK and Retina UK and sat on research committees for the Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust
