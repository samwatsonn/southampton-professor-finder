Biography
Biography
Jacqui graduated as a Registered Nurse with BSc (1st Class Hons) from the University of Surrey, UK in 1990. Her clinical career in the specialist field of infection prevention spans three decades, working in the UK in Brighton, London and Southampton. Throughout her career, Jacqui has combined her clinical and academic work; having completed her PhD in 2004 she was awarded a Senior Clinical Academic Research Fellowship in 2008, pioneering a new joint appointment as a clinical nurse specialist and post-doctoral research fellow. In 2013 she was awarded a HEFCE/NIHR Senior Clinical Lectureship, gaining a tenured position as Associate Clinical Professor in 2014. Jacqui is Deputy Editor of the Journal of Infection Prevention. She has completed a term of office as a board member of the Infection Prevention Society and was professional advisor for the 'epic3' national evidence-based guidelines for preventing healthcare-associated infections in hospitals in England.
