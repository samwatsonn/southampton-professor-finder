Biography
Biography
After securing his PhD from the University of Torino, Stefano Moretti was Post-Doctoral Research Associate (PDRA) at the University of Cambridge, then Senior PDRA at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) and the University of Oxford. Subsequently, he was Fellow as well as Scientific Associate at CERN. He permanently moved to the University of Southampton on an STFC Advanced Fellowship in 2003.
Stefano Moretti is now Professor at the University of Southampton and Director of the NExT Institute. He is also Visiting Staff in RAL PPD. Furthermore, he is a member of the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.  Finally, since 2022, he is also Full Professor within the Theoretical Particle Physics group in the Division of High Energy Physics (HEP) at the Department of Physics & Astronomy of Uppsala University.
Prof Moretti is the Post-Graduate (PG) Recruitment Officer for the Southampton High Energy Physics (SHEP) group.
He is member of the Senior Management Team (SMT), Teaching Committee (TC) and Recuitment Committee (RC) of the Data Intensive Science Centre in the South-East Physics network (DISCnet).
He is the Southampton PG Training Director for the Graduate school (GRADnet) of the South-East Physics network (SEPnet).
He has regularly acted as referee/panel member/(vice-)chair of grant applications to EU Framework Programmes 6 & 7, ESF, Italy-INFN, UK Royal Society, UK Leverhulme Trust, UK-CCLRC, UK-PPARC/STFC, US-NSF and US-DoE, Swedish NSF & Wallenberg, Estonian Research Council (ETF/ETAg), NWO (The Netherlands), CONICYT (Chile), GIF (Germany/Israel), SNSF (Switzerland), National Science Centre (Poland), IRIS-RPF (Cyprus), FWO (Belgium), etc.
Furthermore, Prof Moretti joined the prestigious panel membership of the UK 2021 Reference Excellent Framework (REF 2021). As a member of the Physics panel (Unit of Assessment 9), he evaluated the submissions of all Physics & Astronomy Departments in the UK, with ranking determining the distribution of an Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), Scottish Funding Council (SFC), Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) and Department for the Economy, Northern Ireland (DfE) funding allocation in excess of 1.8bn GBP.
Finally, he acted as an assessor for the equivalent Italian exercise  (VQR 2015-2019) and is currently advising on Science Policy ad Assessment Methods within Horizon Europe.
