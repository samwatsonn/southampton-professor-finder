Biography
Having graduated with a Doctor of Medicine in 1990 Dr Haitchi trained as an Emergency Physician and General Practitioner in Austria.  In 1996 he moved to South Africa where he completed his specialist training in Internal Medicine with a special interest in Pulmonary Medicine at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town in 2001. He also graduated with a Master in Medicine (Internal Medicine) in 2020. Coming as Clinical Research Fellow to Southampton in England in 2001 he completed his Doctor of Philosophy in Molecular Biology in 2008 and his Postgraduate Certificate in Education in 2009 and became a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA). He holds an affiliate membership of the Royal College of Physicians since 2011 and was awarded the title of ‘Privatdozent’ for Pneumology at the Private Medical University Salzburg, Austria in 2014.
Dr Haitchi held a Medical Research Council (MRC) Clinician Scientist Fellowship from 2010 to 2014 in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Southampton.  This MRC fellowship took him from 2010-2011 to the USA, where he did research as a visiting scientist and scholar in Professor Whitsett's pulmonary biology lab in Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.
