About
(Updated Oct 2023)
Dr Chengchen Zhang is currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the Digital Health & Biomedical Engineering Group (DHBE), which is a part of the School of Electronics and Computer Science (ECS) at the University of Southampton, UK. Dr Zhang was the winner of the Newton International Fellowship from the Royal Society, UK.
Before joining Southampton, Dr Zhang finished her PhD and Postdoc training at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia, under the supervision of Prof. Kourosh Kalantar-Zadeh and Prof. Ewa Goldys, respectively. Her work was focused on 1) investigating the unique physical and chemical properties of liquid metals based nanomaterials for health monitoring and therapeutics, and 2) developing highly sensitive point-of-care (POCT) diagnostic platforms for rapid disease diagnosis. Dr Zhang has published over 20 peer-reviewed articles in highly prestigious journals including ACS Nano, Advanced Functional Materials, Small, Chemistry of Materials, ACS Applied Materials Interfaces, and Applied Materials Today. Her works have been cited more than 600 times (h index = 15, based on the source of Google Scholar.)
Dr. Zhang's research group aims to tackle the challenges in health monitoring and therapeutics by harnessing the unique properties of nanomaterials and the power of artificial intelligence (AI).  At present, she is supervising/co-supervising 3 PhD students and 1 undergraduate student.
Fields of Expertise:
Exploring the distinctive physical and chemical attributes of liquid metal-based nanomaterials for disease therapy and health monitoring.
Creating highly sensitive point-of-care diagnostic devices for swift and accurate disease diagnosis.
Formulating polymeric drug delivery systems for precise control and sustained release of therapeutic agents.
