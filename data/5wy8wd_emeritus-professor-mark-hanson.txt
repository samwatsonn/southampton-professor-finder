Biography
Mark Hanson is Emeritus Professor of Human Development and Health and British Heart Foundation Professor at the University of Southampton, UK. He is a founder and past-President of the International DOHaD Society. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. He co-Chaired the FIGO Pregnancy and NCDs Committee and the Science and Evidence Working Group for the WHO Ending Childhood Obesity Commission. He chairs the Knowledge and Evidence Working Group of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (hosted by WHO). He researches how nutrition and the developmental environment affects health across the life-course, starting before conception. His interdisciplinary work crosses developmental and evolutionary biology and the social sciences. Mark pioneered LifeLab to promote health literacy in adolescents. He advocates developmental science to inform public health policy.
