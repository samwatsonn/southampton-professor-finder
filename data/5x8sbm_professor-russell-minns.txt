Biography
Professor Russell Minns graduated with a first-class degree in Chemistry from Kings College London in 2001. He then worked with Professor Helen Fielding on Rydberg molecules obtaining his PhD in 2005. Following postdoctoral positions at the University of Virginia and UCL he was awarded a Ramsay Memorial Fellowship in 2009. In 2011 he moved to the University of Southampton to begin a Royal Society University Research Fellowship. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 2019 and to Professor in 2023.
