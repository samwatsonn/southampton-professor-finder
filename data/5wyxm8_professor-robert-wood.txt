Professor Robert Wood
Professor of Surface Engand Tribology
Research interests
Professor Robert Wood has research interests that span the application of lubrication, wear and friction science to current and next generation critical machine components such as bearings, transmissions, turbines, pumps, renewable energy systems and electrification of transportation. His research projects look at detecting wear, corrosion, friction and lubrication using these measurements to improve condition monitoring of machines including EVs and aeroengine fan blades and to optimise surface engineering for extended service life, energy efficiency and to drive tribology based digital twins and machine learning development.

Biography
National Centre for Advanced Tribology at Southampton (nCATS)
Associate Dean Research for faculty of Engineering and the Environment
Robert Wood is Professor of Surface Engineering and Tribology and has 30 yearsâ€™ experience of tribology and surface engineering. He has spent 4 years at BP before returning to Southampton to re-establish surface engineering/tribology research. His group was awarded Â£10M from EPSRC in 2008 to create the National Centre for Advanced Tribology at Southampton (nCATS) and was awarded a further Â£3M for research into Green Tribology. He is Chairof UK Tribology and was Editor-in-chief between 2016 and 2021of theIoP Journal: Surface Topography - metrology and properties. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2016. He was awarded the Annual Donald Julius Groen Prize in 2011 and the Tribology Trust Silver medal in 2018 for his outstanding achievements in tribology.
