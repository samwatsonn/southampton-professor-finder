Biography
After a degree in Biology from the University of Nottingham, Nick completed a PhD at King's College under the supervision of Prof John Pickup, where he researched techniques in fluorescence spectroscopy for tracking metabolism in cells by using their natural fluorescence. After experiencing some of the excitement of stem cell biology, he worked as an MRC postdoctoral fellow at Imperial College researching the effects of extracellular matrix on the differentiation of embryonic stem cells. He then took a postdoctoral position at Stanford University to study how delivery of Wnt proteins in liposome carriers could be used to promote wound healing, before his appointment at Southampton.
His research focusses now focusses in biomaterials in drug delivery and regenerative medicine. He has held personal fellowships at Stanford University and at Imperial College. His research is highly multidisciplinary, at the interface of the biological, medical, engineering and chemical sciences.
He has been awarded ~£2 M in grant income, and he has more than 4500 citations, >2000 of which are post-2016, with papers published in high impact and respected journals such as PNAS, Nature Materials and ACS Nano.
