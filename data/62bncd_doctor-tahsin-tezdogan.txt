Biography
Biography
Dr Tahsin Tezdogan is currently an Associate Professor in Maritime Engineering in the Department of Civil, Maritime and Environmental Engineering at the University of Southampton. Dr Tezdogan received his PhD degree in 2015 from the University of Strathclyde from the Department Naval Architecture, Ocean and Marine Engineering, with his PhD thesis entitled, 'Potential Flow and CFD-Based Hydrodynamic Analyses of Mono- and Multi-Hull Vessels’.
Dr Tezdogan has a broad range of research interests, including CFD simulations of ship motions and resistance, the added resistance of ships due to waves, and the investigation of ship behaviour and performance in channels/canals. He worked on a number of internationally collaborated EU, Newton Fund and Global Challenges projects.
To date, Dr Tezdogan has published more than 60 papers in highly ranked journals and has presented his research at several international conferences and workshops. In addition to this, Dr Tezdogan has acted as guest editors for an Ocean Engineering Special Issue on ‘CFD Applications in Ship and Offshore Structures’ and for an Applied Ocean Research Special Issue on 'Resistance, seakeeping and manoeuvrability of ships in restricted waters'. In January 2023 he was appointed as a Co-Editor-in-Chief for Ocean Engineering journal. In September 2017, Dr Tezdogan was appointed to an ITTC Specialist Committee on Combined CFD/EFD Methods for a duration of four years. More recently he has been appointed to ITTC's Quality Systems Group for three years. He is also a member of RINA and IMarEST. Dr Tezdogan has been a Professional Affairs and Education Committee (PAEC) member of the Institute of Marine Engineering, Science & Technology (IMarEST) since May 2019. The PAEC is responsible for setting IMarEST’s academic and professional development standards, making the final decisions regarding the accreditation of academic courses and graduate training programmes and the granting of IMarEST recognition for relevant CPD courses.
Dr Tezdogan has also been selected as one of the 20 members of the UK Shipbuilding Skills Taskforce. UK Shipbuilding Skills Taskforce (UKSST) forms a partnership between government, industry, training providers and trade representative bodies. The Taskforce supports the development and implementation of a future-focused skills strategy for shipbuilding. Working closely with the Ministry of Defence (MoD), the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the Department for Transport (DfT), it aims to build a picture of the industry’s skills needs and provide solutions to skills shortages, particularly those related to new and emerging technologies.
Dr Tezdogan has also been selected as a Reviewer or an Evaluator for some EU- Horizon 2020 and Newton Fund calls. More recently he was invited to evaluate some proposals for Portugual's research council, as a member of their engineering panel. Dr Tezdogan was a local organising committee member for the recent OMAE 2019 conference, in addition to being a member of the OMAE short course committee. He also delivered a short course for OMAE 2019 in June 2019.
