Biography
About
Jonathan Flynn is in the Theoretical Particle Physics research group, with particular interest in lattice QCD supercomputer simulations for flavour physics and wider interests in flavour physics phenomenology. He came to Southampton in 1991 after a PhD at Harvard University and postdoctoral positions at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), Chicago. He has been Head of Department (2015-2019) and was previously in charge of undergraduate teaching as Director of Programmes. He has been external examiner for theoretical physics degree programmes at the University of Edinburgh and Trinity College Dublin. He is a past chair of the CERN Computing Resources Scrutiny Group, scrutinising the computing requirements of the four main LHC experiments. He is also a past chair of STFC's GridPP Oversight Committee, monitoring the UK's contribution to the worldwide LHC computing grid (wLCG).

Current research
Lattice QCD supercomputer simulations for flavour physics and wider interests in flavour physics phenomenology. This means doing numerical simulations of the strong interactions of quarks and gluons in order to understand masses and decays of particles (eg, B-mesons, kaons, pions) seen at particle physics experiments at hadron or e+e- colliders. By detailed comparison of theoretical computations with experimental results we can test the consistency of the Standard Model of particle physics and look for small deviations pointing to new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Teaching
Undergraduate teaching for mainly core physics modules in 1st and 2nd year, covering mechanics, energy and matter, electromagnetism, waves and quanta. I have also taught advanced quantum physics for fourth year students and teach quantum field theory within the NExT PhD training school. I act as personal tutor for several undergraduates in each year of study, supervise undergraduate projects and do a variety of other roles associated with teaching. I am one of the Senior Tutors for Physics and Astrnomy and am chair of the postgraduate Special Considerations Board for the Faculty of Physical Sciences and Engineering.
