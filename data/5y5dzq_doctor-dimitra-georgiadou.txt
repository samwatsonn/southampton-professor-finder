Biography
About
Dimitra earned her PhD in Chemical Engineering/Organic Electronics from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece, while she holds a BSc in Chemical Engineering (majoring Materials Science) from the same University. She also holds a Master’s Degree (Honours) in Advanced Materials Science awarded jointly from the Technical University of Munich, Ludvig-Maximilians University of Munich and University of Augsburg in Germany. As a post-graduate, she gained industrial experience through internships in Procter & Gamble, Italy, and Schreiner Group, Germany.

Current research
Dimitra’s research interests involve the fabrication and optimisation of nanoscale opto/electronic devices by applying novel materials concepts, alternative patterning techniques and solution-based processes compatible with flexible substrates and printable electronics. During her PhD and first post-doc positions, she developed organic and inorganic materials-based thin films to act as interfacial layers in high performance Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) and Organic Photovoltaic Cells (OPVs). Then, she went on to explore the fabrication and characterisation of coplanar nanogap separated metal electrodes on rigid or flexible substrates using a high throughput, scalable, inexpensive technique, named adhesion lithography. Dimitra is currently interested in combining these coplanar electrodes with functional organic, inorganic and hybrid materials to develop advanced opto/electronic devices targeting high speed applications, such as high– and ultra-high frequency (HF & UHF) radio frequency diodes, high response speed photodetectors, fast switching light-emitting diodes and novel optoelectronic memristors operating as photonic artificial synapses.
