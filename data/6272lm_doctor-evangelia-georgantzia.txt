Biography
Biography
Dr Georgantzia joined the University of Southampton as Teaching Fellow in September 2022. She received her PhD from Liverpool John Moores University in December 2022. Particularly, her PhD research focused on the development and use of advanced computational and experimental techniques for structural assessment and evaluation of aluminium structures. New design methods and modifications of European design standard (Eurocode 9) were also suggested towards a more safe, accurate and thereby economically design process. She holds a first-class with distinction MSc in Earthquake Engineering and Seismic Design of Structures with distinction from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Greece) in 2019. During her MSc studies she worked as a research assistant and her thesis was part of the research project Sustainable Preconstructed Innovative Module (SUPRIM), which was co-financed by the EU and Greek national funds (project code: T1EDK-03042). She earned her first-class MΕng degree with distinction in Civil Engineering from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Greece) in 2017. During her MEng studies she specialised in the structural engineering, and she completed them with an overall grade of 9/10. It is also noteworthy that this mark ranked her in the 17th position among 6500 graduates since the establishment of the Civil Engineering Department in 1955.
Dr Georgantzia is a Fellow of Higher Education Academy (FHEA) since 2022. During the final year of her PhD studies, she worked as a Lecturer in Hugh Baird College situated in Liverpool. Her role there was to deliver part of the Pearson BTEC Level 3 National Extended Diploma in Construction and the Built Environment. Through these sessions she recruited post-16 learners for continuing their studies in Higher Education providing suitable fundamental knowledge and skills.
During her PhD studies she has also served as the Post Graduate Year Representative for the School of Civil Engineering Built Environment and worked hard towards the improvement of the academic environment for all the postgraduate students in the School. She has been mentoring a group of new postgraduate researchers to settle into MPhil/PhD study and university life. For this reason, she received training through the Institute of Leadership and Management and Liverpool John Moores University Development Programme in Coaching and Mentoring. Finally, having the dual role of the Vice Chair of the ICE (NorthWest) Graduate and Student (G&S) Committee as well as the LJMU Student Representative in the ICE (NorthWest) – Merseyside Branch, she was assisting in identifying events, speakers and venues as well as promoting branch activities and regional events.
