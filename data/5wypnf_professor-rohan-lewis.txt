Biography
Biography
Rohan Lewis is Professor in Placental and Integrative Physiology in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Southampton.
Professor Lewis leads the Placental Research Laboratory in Southampton. His team are focused on understanding how the placenta supports the growth of a healthy fetus and how placental dysfunction may impact health across the life course.
The placental research group takes an integrative and interdisciplinary approach to understanding placental function. This involves integrating laboratory studies of transport and metabolism with 3D imaging and computational modelling. This work involves interdisciplinary collaborations with Engineering, Maths and Physics. This seeks to both understand the mechanisms underlying specific placental functions and how these mechanisms interact to form a functioning placenta and produce a healthy baby.
We are also involved with population studies including the Southampton Women’s Survey and the Mavidos study to understand how the environment affects the placental and how placental function affects health in postnatal life.
