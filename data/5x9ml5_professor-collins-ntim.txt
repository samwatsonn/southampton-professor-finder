Biography
Professor Collins Ntim is a Professor of Accounting and was previously the Deputy Head of School (Research & Enterprise) within the Business School at the University of Southampton.
He has also previously held junior (Lecturer), mid-career (Senior Lecturer and Associate Professor) and senior (Full Professor, Associate Dean and Head of Department) academic roles at Aberystwyth University, University of Glasgow and University of Huddersfield.
Collins is also a full panel member of the UK 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF2021) Sub-Panel 17: Business and Management Studies.
He is known internationally for his research in Accounting, Finance, Governance, Development and Sustainability, especially Accounting and Governance (corporate governance and financial reporting – market-based accounting research); Accountability, Development, Ethics and Sustainability (social & environmental accounting – corporate social responsibility, and sustainability accounting & reporting); and Finance & Development (corporate finance – market-based finance research and financial economics – development finance).
Collins has published over 100 outputs, with over 70% appearing in FT 50, ABS 4*/3* and ABDC A*/A internationally leading journals, such as the Abacus; Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal; British Accounting Review; British Journal of Management; Corporate Governance: An International Review; Journal of Business Ethics; The International Journal of Accounting; and The Leadership Quarterly, amongst many others.
His work has featured frequently in reputable popular media channels, including TV (e.g., TRT World, Sky, UK), Radio (e.g., BBC 5live) and the Financial Press (e.g., Financial Times, UK) around the world, as well as cited widely by peers, policymakers (e.g., The Public Accounts Committee, UK Parliament, and The Low Pay Commission, UK), and practitioners.
He serves as founding editor, editor, guest editor, associate editor and editorial board member of a numberof top international academic journals (e.g., Accounting Forum, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal; Accounting Forum; Business & Society; Corporate Governance: An International Review; Journal of Accounting Literature, Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation, and The International Journal of Accounting) and reviewer for several internationally leading academic journals (e.g., Abacus; Academy of Management Learning & Education; Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal; Accounting and Business Research; British Journal of Management; Corporate Governance: An International Review; European Accounting Review; Journal of Business Ethics; and Journal of Management Studies, etc), research councils (e.g., British Academy; ESRC, and EPSRC, UK; and Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council, Canada, etc), and academic bodies and conferences (e.g., British Accounting and Finance Association, etc), as well as external examiner of degree programmes at a number of universities.
Collins has presented his research at a large number of top national and international conferences (e.g., American Accounting Association; British Accounting and Finance Association; and European Accounting Association), workshops, and seminars in various countries, as well as won competitive internal and external research grant awards of total value of over £0.6m from reputable funding bodies, such as the Economic and Social Research Council, UK, Financial Reporting Council, UK, and World Bank.
His teaching interests cut across Accounting, Finance and Governance, having taught modules, such as Business Finance; Corporate Finance; Corporate Governance; Financial Accounting; Management Accounting; and Research Methods to undergraduate, postgraduate and professional accounting and finance students.
