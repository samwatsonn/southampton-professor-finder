Biography
Biography
Dr Helena Fisk is a postdoctoral research fellow in Nutrition and Metabolism and teaching fellow in undergraduate medicine within the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Southampton.
Dr Fisk completed an Undergraduate degree in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Brighton which established an interest in human nutrition and health. She held a research technician position at the University of Southampton working on several projects in the theme of human nutrition, inflammation and disease with focus on omega-3 lipids, publishing over 20 peer-reviewed research papers in this area. Dr Fisk completed her PhD at the University of Southampton investigating obesity associated inflammation in subcutaneous white adipose tissue and responses to marine derived long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Her research focusses on inflammation across the life course with particular interest in obesity and ageing, and the immunomodulatory actions of nutrients including omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty, probiotics and vitamin D. Her research has shown novel changes to inflammatory lipid signalling and metabolism in obesity, and disparities in the regulation of lipid signalling molecules and gene expression by omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in obesity.
Dr Fisk is a teaching fellow on the undergraduate medicine programme (across BM5/6/EU programmes) and supporting research projects of University of Southampton and international students. Outside of academia, Dr Fisk is a member of the SCI lipids group committee and has developed public engagement activities in the theme of human nutrition and health.
