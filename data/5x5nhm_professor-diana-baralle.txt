Biography
Professor Baralle is Professor of Genomic Medicine and Associate Dean (Research) in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Southampton.
She was also awarded the prestigious NIHR Research Professorship in 2017 and is the Vice President and President elect of the Clinical Genetics Society.
Having graduated in medicine from the University of London, she trained first in Paediatrics and then Clinical Genetics. She completed her MD and research training fellowship in the Department of Pathology, Cambridge University. She held an academic position in Cambridge before her current appointment in Southampton and combines her clinical work with research.
Professor Baralle leads a group that investigates the role of RNA and splicing in genetic disease, new methods for genetic diagnostic testing, and the causes of rare disease syndromes. She is clinical specialty lead for Genetics for the Wessex CRN. Her group comprises both clinical and non-clinical scientists and students.
She is a consultant in Clinical Genetics at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, and has general genetics clinics as well as a specialist oculogenetics clinic.
