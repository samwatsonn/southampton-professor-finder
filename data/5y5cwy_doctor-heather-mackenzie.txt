Biography
With an undergraduate degree in Psychology, Heather completed her PhD in Health Sciences in 2009 at the University of Portsmouth, in which she developed and validated a health-related quality of life scale for teenagers with food allergies. She subsequently worked as a researcher and lecturer in Health Sciences at the University of Portsmouth, undertaking a range of primary and secondary research on food allergies and elderly care, contributing guest lectures on quality of life in food allergy, teaching evidence-based practice and research methods at all levels (including as a module lead), leading a short course on evidence-based practice for healthcare professionals, and supervising PGRs on PhD and Professional Doctorate programmes.
During this time, Heather also contributed to the University-wide supervisor training programme as well as the PGR Professional Development Programme and established a firm enthusiasm for ensuring that PGRs are able to access high quality support for their professional and career development from all those involved with their studies. Hence, in 2013 Heather was delighted to be appointed to the role of Researcher Development Coordinator within the Graduate School at Portsmouth, where she worked for 7 years continuing to develop the University-wide Graduate School Development Programme and induction events for PGRs, catering to a rapidly growing PGR cohort with a diverse range of professional development needs and circumstances.
Heather joined the University of Southampton in January 2020 as the Doctoral College Professional Development Programme Manager working closely with colleagues in the Doctoral College and the Centre for Higher Education Practice, as well as in the Faculties and Professional Services to ensure that we have a high quality and comprehensive professional development provision for postgraduate researchers (PGRs). As part of the Doctoral College and CHEP teams, Heather leads our Doctoral College Professional Development Programme and Doctoral College PGR Events Programme, and contributes to our induction for new PGRs.
In her role, Heather counts herself extremely fortunate to work closely with a range of academic and professional services colleagues across the University as well as our fantastic postgraduate researchers. She also liaises and collaborates with other Researcher Developers nationally through a range of networks and contributes to international conferences in the area.
