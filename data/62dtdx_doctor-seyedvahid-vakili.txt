Biography
Biography
Capt. Dr. Seyedvahid Vakili is an experienced professional with over 20 years of expertise in the maritime industry and academia. His background encompasses extensive service on ocean-going and offshore vessels before transitioning into the field of education. Throughout his career, he has actively participated in oil and gas development projects, showcasing a strong dedication to applying theoretical knowledge to practical technical problem solving.
Capt. Dr. Vakili possesses a profound understanding of ship safety, environmental protection, and air emissions reduction, with comprehensive expertise in the entire life cycle of the maritime industry, including design, construction, operation, and recycling.
In 2017, he enrolled in the Maritime Energy Management (MEM) program at the World Maritime University (WMU). During his time at WMU, he displayed exceptional proficiency in the Maritime Energy Management program and graduated with distinction, earning his MSc degree in Malmö, Sweden. His academic achievements and dedication led him to become the inaugural graduate of the MEM specialization to successfully complete his Ph.D. His doctoral research focused on enhancing energy efficiency and reducing air emissions from maritime land-based infrastructures, with a particular emphasis on adopting a life cycle perspective.
Prior to joining the University of Southampton, he served as a Research Associate in different projects at WMU, further solidifying his expertise in the field. Dr. Vakili's research interests revolve around adopting a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to effectively minimize air emissions. He places a strong emphasis on exploring alternative fuels, Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) technologies, renewable energy sources, and enhancing energy efficiency across the entire life cycle of ships. Additionally, he investigates the implications of these efforts on ports and shipyards, considering their role in sustainable maritime practices and policies. Furthermore, he is deeply passionate about addressing cyber security concerns and mitigating underwater noise pollution originating from commercial vessels, with a particular interest in its correlation with energy efficiency.
Capt. Dr. Vakili has actively participated in many global projects and collaborated with prestigious national and international organizations, including the International Maritime Organization (IMO), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), European Union (EU), World Bank, classification societies, Transport Canada, Port Authorities, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA). He is also an accomplished author and co-author of several influential journal articles and conference papers focused on vital topics such as maritime decarbonization, zero-emission solutions for ships, ports, and shipyards, underwater noise pollution, and maritime cybersecurity. His work has been featured in renowned academic conferences like the International Association of Maritime Economists (IAME) and the International Education Conference (INTED), as well as reputable journals such as the Journal of Cleaner Production, Journal of Sustainable Cities and Society, International Journal of Energy, International Journal of Energy Research, Energy Conservation and Management, (EU) Science for Environment Policy, Royal Institution of Naval Architects (RINA) Magazine, Marine Pollution Bulletin, and Marine Policy Journal. Furthermore, he actively contributes as a reviewer for various reputable academic journals.
