Biography
Biography
Carole joined Health Sciences in 2019, and is a Senior Research Fellow working on an NIHR funded Frailty Dynamics project. She is interested in the health and social care pathways and outcomes for older adults, especially for people living with frailty or dementia. Carole is passionate about the use of ‘big data’ to answer questions in this area, with the purpose of directly informing changes in services to benefit patients.
“Things get done only if the data we gather can inform and inspire those in a position to make a difference” – Mike Schmoker
Carole studied Biological Sciences at the University of Oxford, and Control of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. She completed her PhD at the University of Southampton, which examined the hospital outcomes of older people with cognitive impairment using a large secondary care dataset.
Carole has extensive experience in the design, conduct and analysis of quantitative and mixed-methods clinical research studies, including epidemiological studies and clinical trials. She has worked as an epidemiologist/clinical trialist for Epicentre/Médècins sans Frontières in Africa, running disease surveillance programmes and clinical trials for new treatments for infectious diseases. She has expertise in pharmacovigilance, including analysing large international and UK-based datasets of safety data for medicines prescribed in primary care.
Carole has also spent 10 years working with clinicians in the NHS to develop, obtain funding for, and deliver clinical research studies, and as a Senior Reseach Advisor in the NIHR Research Design Service. These have encompassed many clinical disciplines, including older people’s medicine, emergency care, respiratory conditions, gastroenterology and surgery, and involved working closely with commercial partners to develop and test new products intended for use in the NHS. All studies have involved patients and the public to inform the study design, particularly those aspects relating to participant involvement, and plans for dissemination.
Carole is also an experienced educator, having taught evidence-based medicine, research design and public engagement to post-graduate and medical students at the University of Portsmouth and Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust. She also contributed to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine’s distance learning MSc courses in Public Health and Clinical Trials for many years. She now contributes to undergraduate and postgraduate teaching within Health Sciences.
