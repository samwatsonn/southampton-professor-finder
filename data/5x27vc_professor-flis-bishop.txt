Biography
Felicity has an MA in Experimental Psychology from the University of Oxford (The Queen’s College) and an MSc in Health Psychology from the University of Southampton. In 2006 she obtained her PhD in Psychology from the University of Southampton. Following some postdoctoral work Felicity moved to Primary Care and Population Sciences within the Faculty of Medicine to take up an Arthritis Research UK (now Versus Arthritis) Career Development Fellowship. Versus Arthritis also supported a short-term visit to Ted Kaptchuk's lab at Harvard, where she was also a visiting researcher developing a programme of work around lay perspectives on placebo effects. Back in Southampton, in 2012 Felicity took up a Lectureship in Health Psychology and in 2015 became Associate Professor in Health Psychology.  Felicity's work on psychological aspects of complementary and integrative medicine led to her selection through international open competition as 1 of 12 inaugural international complementary medicine research fellows at the Australian Research Centre for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University of Technology Sydney.
