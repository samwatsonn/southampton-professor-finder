Biography
Biography
Lynn graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a BSc (Hons) in Nursing. She worked clinically in palliative and HIV/AIDS care, completed her education as a mental health nurse and worked in acute mental health before undertaking her doctorate at the University of Edinburgh. Lynn has held academic positions at the Universities of Glasgow and Manchester. Lynn joined the Macmillan Survivorship Research Group (now CentRIC) in 2012 after completing an MRC post-doctoral fellowship in health services research and health of the public at the University of Manchester, to develop an intervention for the follow-up of lung cancer patients after primary treatment.
Between 2020 and 2022 Lynn was appointed to the role of group manager within the pre-registration nursing team, leading a group of staff that integrate research and education.
Lynn was a member of the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) and until 2023 she was the Chair of the Advanced Disease and End of Life Care Workstream & Member Living with and Beyond Cancer Executive Group. She was also a member of the NCRI Lung Cancer Group until 2023.
