Biography
Professor Moon joined the University of Southampton in 2007 as Professor of Spatial Analysis in Human Geography. At Southampton he served successively as Deputy Head (Education), Deputy Head (Research) and Acting Joint Head of School for Geography before becoming Associate Dean (Research and Enterprise) for the then Faculty of Social, Human and Mathematical Sciences.   Prior to joining Southampton he was the University Director of Research and  Professor of Health Services Research at the University of Portsmouth. He has held visiting professorships in New Zealand and France and led the Royal Geographical Society health geography research group. He founded and continues as emeritus editor-in-chief of Health and Place, the leading journal for place-related social research on health.
Professor Moon’s research focusses on health geography, with a particular concern for the difference that place makes to health-related behaviours  and mental health service use, and the small area estimation of health indicators. He was elected to the Fellowship of the Academy of Social Sciences in 2011, and to Honorary Membership of the Faculty of Public Health in 2012. In 2022 he received the American Association of Geographers Melinda Meade Award for distinguished scholarship in health geography. His research on smoking prevalence, small area estimation of health indicators, and mental health care has impacted significantly on national policy.
