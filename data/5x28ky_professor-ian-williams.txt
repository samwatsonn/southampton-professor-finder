Biography
Biography
Ian obtained his first degree in Chemistry from the University of Surrey in 1988 and a PhD in Public Attitudes to Air Pollution from Road Traffic from Middlesex University in 1995. He has been a lecturer at Middlesex University (1989-2000), the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan, 2000-2004) and the University of Southampton (UoS, 2005-present). He was the founder and Head of the Centre for Waste Management at the UCLan. He has appeared numerous times on broadcast media, including on BBC Radio 4’s Costing the Earth.
Ian has received a number of awards for his activities, including: the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education’s Campus Sustainability Research Award 2018, the International Solid Waste Association Publication Award in 2016 and 2017, the Institution of Civil Engineers Baker Medal in 2010 and awards from the Chartered Institute of Wastes Management (Waste Regulation Award 2010, 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15; James Jackson Award 2006, 2015/16, 2016/17; J.C. Dawes Award 2016). He is a fanatical fan of "the Scarlets" rugby team.
