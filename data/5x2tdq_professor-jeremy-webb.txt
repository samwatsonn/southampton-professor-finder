Biography
Biography
Jeremy S Webb is Professor of Microbiology within Biological Sciences at the University of Southampton, and co-Director for the UKâ€™s National Biofilms Innovation Centre (NBIC). His research is focused on the understanding of complex microbial consortia and biofilms, their ecology, physiology and life-cycle dynamics, and how they respond to environmental stresses including therapeutic compounds. He has worked to develop national, international and interdisciplinary strategies in research and innovation in order to advance technology development and to address global challenges relevant to biofilms. NBIC is a Â£26m UKRI Innovation and Knowledge Centre (IKC). This is a multi-institutional and interdisciplinary centre, working together with an industry hub, that provides a platform for academic and business connectivity across the UK. With this platform and the NBIC team, we are developing technologies and interventions for the control of complex microbial communities that are central to some of the most urgent societal challenges including water, food and energy security and safety, and AMR.
