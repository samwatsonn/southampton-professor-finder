Biography
Prof Crabb graduated in Medicine from St George’s Hospital Medical School in 1996 and joined the University in 2002 as a Cancer Research UK Clinical Research Fellow. His PhD was awarded in 2006 for research on the pre-clinical development of histone deacetylase inhibitors. This was followed by post-doctoral training as a Clinical Research Fellow at the BC Cancer Agency in Vancouver and the Cancer Research UK Centre in Southampton. He was appointed as an Honorary Consultant in Medical Oncology at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust in 2009, with specialist clinical interests in bladder, prostate and adrenal cancers. He is a lead for early phase cancer clinical trials for solid malignancies and established the UHS early phase cancer trials clinic.
