Biography
Biography
Philip N. Bartlett received a BA in Chemistry from the University of Oxford in 1978.  He was awarded a British Petroleum Scholarship to study for a Ph.D. in Photoelectrochemistry under the supervision of Professor W. John Albery FRS at Imperial College and received his PhD in 1981.  Following his PhD Professor Bartlett was awarded a Research Fellowship from the Royal Society for the Exhibition of 1851 to work on modified electrodes at Imperial College.  In 1984 he was appointed to a lectureship in Physical Chemistry at the University of Warwick and in 1991 as Professor of Physical Chemistry at the University of Bath.  Since 1993 he has been at the University of Southampton where he is Professor of Electrochemistry.
