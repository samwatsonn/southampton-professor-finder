Biography
Biography
In the past hypothesis-driven research in the life sciences has been the domain of experimental biologists, with the role of biostatisticians and bioinformaticians being one of support. This is no longer the case. As the “data deluge” continues, my research interests have focused on using biological “big data” to create and test hypotheses.My primary research interest is understanding how genes and drugs can coordinate changes in cellular phenotypes and use this to treat disease or initiate transdifferentiation. I have approached this problem by integrating varied data sources, developing algorithms and close collaboration with experimental scientists.
