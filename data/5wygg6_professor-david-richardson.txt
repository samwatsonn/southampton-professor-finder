Biography
About
Professor David John Richardson FRS, FREng obtained his B.Sc. and PhD in fundamental physics from Sussex University U.K. in 1985 and 1989 respectively. He joined the Optoelectronics Research Centre (ORC) at Southampton University in 1989 and was awarded a Royal Society University Fellowship in 1991 in recognition of his pioneering work on short pulsed fibre lasers. Professor Richardson has been Deputy Director of the ORC with responsibility for optical fibre and laser related research since 2000. He has led various large collaborative optical communications research programmes within both the UK and Europe (e.g. most recently the EPSRC Hyperhighway and Airguide Photonics Programmes and the EU PHASORS, MODEGAP and SAFARI projects), published more than 1500 research papers and produced more than 30 patents. Professor Richardson collaborates extensively with Industry and has previously co-founded two spin out companies: SPI Lasers Ltd in 2000 and more recently Lumenisity Ltd in 2017. Professor Richardson was elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2009 and most recently Fellow of the Royal Society in 2018. He is also a Fellow of the IEEE, OSA and IET. He received a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award in 2013 for his optical communications research and was a recipient of the Horizon 2020 “Breaking the Optical Communications Barrier” Prize in 2016.

Professor Richardson is a well-known figure in the international community, for example, he has chaired both leading international conferences on optical telecommunications (OFC and ECOC). He was elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2009 and most recently Fellow of the Royal Society in 2018. He is also a Fellow of the IEEE, OSA and IET. He received a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award in 2013 for his optical communications research and was a recipient of the Horizon 2020 “Breaking the Optical Communications Barrier” Prize in 2016.
Throughout his career Professor Richardson has collaborated extensively with Industry and he has co-founded two successful spin-out companies: SPI Lasers Ltd in 2000 (manufacture of industrial fibre lasers) and more recently Lumenisity Ltd (manufacturer of cables for telecommunications) in 2017.
