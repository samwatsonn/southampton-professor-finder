Biography
About
Dr. Kevin Chung-Che Huang obtained his PhD in optoelectronics from the Optoelectronics Research Centre (ORC) at the University of Southampton in 2005. He has initiated and has been working on functional chalcogenide materials containing S, Se or Te elements fabricated by chemical vapour deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD) and Van der Waals Epitaxy (VdWE) since he began his PhD study at the ORC in 2001. Recently this technology has been applied to fabricate wafer-scale emerging 2D materials, such as graphene and transition metal di-chalcogenides. He has established more than 60 active academic and Industrial collaborations worldwide based on the materials his team fabricates. He has written and contributed to more than 100 publications including recently published journal paper in Nature Photonics and 16 invited talks. He is the holder of a patent based on germanium sulphide based materials fabricated by CVD. Currently, he is a Senior Research Fellow at the ORC and leads research in “Advanced Functional Chalcogenides and 2D Materials” with CVD, ALD and VdWE for photonic devices, phase-change memory, thin-film solar cells, photo-catalyst, nano-electronics and other emerging applications in quantum technologies. His research on CVD and 2D materials has currently contributed to some active research Grants with the total values greater than £21M through EPSRC in the U.K.

Current research
I am currently leading the functional chalcogenides and emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials research at the Optoelectronics Research Centre (ORC), University of Southampton. My research involves the investigation of emerging advanced functional materials with scalable processes. More importantly, to develop large-scale manufacturing methods for emerging 2D materials using novel vapour phase deposition processes, such as chemical vapour deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD) and Van der Waals Epitaxy (VdWE), to enable the production of wafer-scale 2D materials on various substrates, to maximize research output through the international collaborations and to commercialize these 2D materials. The typical applications for functional chalcogenide thin films and 2D materials are as follows,
Chalcogenide materials for integrated photonic applications.
Phase-change memory applications with chalcogenide materials.
Photovoltaic applications with transparent conductive oxides and chalcogenide solar cells.
Photo-catalyst and energy harvesting through emerging 2D materials and their heterostructures.
Chalcogenide thin films and 2D materials for surface plasmonics applications.
2D materials such as Graphene, MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, WSe2, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and BN for optoelectronic applications.
Wafer-scale monolayer 2D TMD semiconductor for Quantum Technologies.
