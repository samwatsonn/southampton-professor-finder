Biography
About
Prof. Senthil Murugan Ganapathy received Ph.D (Photonic Materials) in 2001 from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. He worked as a post-doctoral fellow from 2001 to 2005 at the University of Bordeaux, France and Toyota Technological Institute, Japan. He joined the Optoelectronics Research Centre at the University of Southampton in April 2005 where he is currently a Professor and Head of the Integrated Photonic Devices Group. He is also an Adjunct Professor at the Indian Institute of Technology - Madras, Chennai, India.
His expertise and research interests range from photonic materials to photonic systems with current focus on Mid-IR/high-contrast materials and devices for biomedical sensing, on-chip spectroscopy, on-chip nanoscopy, environmental monitoring and optical communication applications. He has made pioneering contributions in the field of novel optical microresonators. He has received research grant income over £7M as Principal Investigator and Co-Investigator. He established and runs the major Mid-IR characterisation facility, worth about £1M, which is unique for waveguide spectroscopy in the 2-13 μm spectral region.
He has published more than 250 journal and conference papers (h-index: 34) including more than 30 invited talks at major international conferences, 2 patents on new photonic glasses and editor of a book: “Photonic Glasses and Glass-Ceramics”. He is recipient of the Dean’s Award for 2012/2013 for “Outstanding Contributions in Teaching” for MSc (Photonic Technologies) teaching at the University of Southampton. He served as Programme Chair of the “Young Scientists Forum” in the international conference ICOOPMA-14 held in Leeds, UK. He is also in the International Advisory Committee of the biennial International Conference ICOOPMA. He is Editor of Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics published by Springer. He is Topic Editor of MDPI’s Photonics journal and on the Editorial board of MDPI’s Electronics journal. He is Fellow of The Higher Education Academy of the UK.
