Biography
Dr Nong Gao is Lecturer within Engineering and Physical Sciences at the University of Southampton.
He obtained his PhD from the University of Sheffield in 1994, and then did research for six years at the University of Strathclyde and the University of Sheffield. He joined the University of Southampton as a Research Fellow in 2000, a Senior Research Fellow in 2003, and a Lecturer in 2007. He is a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy in the UK.
Nong Gao has many years research experience in materials characterisation, mechanical property evaluation, creep-fatigue, rolling contact mechanism, and ultrafine grained (UFG) and nanostructured materials processed by severe plastic deformation (SPD). At the moment, the main focus of his research is on microstructure, properties of alloys for additive manufactured materials, including fatigue, corrosion and wear. He is on Editorial Board of Journal of Metals, and Associate Editorial Board of Materials Letters. To date, he has published over 170 papers in journals and conferences, with over 5200 citations and h-index: 44.
Nong Gao has been involving in teaching for several modules, including Properties of Materials, Microstructural Engineering for Transport Applications, and Materials and Structures. Currently, he is the module lead for FEEG2001 Systems Design and Computing.
