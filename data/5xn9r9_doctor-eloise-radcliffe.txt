Biography
Biography
Dr Eloise Radcliffe is a Senior Research Fellow working in the School of Primary Care, Population Sciences and Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine at the University of Southampton. She is a qualitative researcher with a background in social science and has 20 years of experience working in health services research and evaluation in both academic settings and voluntary sector organisations. She is currently a researcher on the MODIFY study funded by NIHR Wessex Applied Research Collaboration (ARC). The study aims to design and test a multidisciplinary medication review and deprescribing intervention in primary care for older people living with frailty and polypharmacy. She is also co-applicant on the SPiDeR study on the role of social prescribing in medication review and deprescribing in primary care, funded by National Institute of Health and Care Research.
Eloise has an MSc in Sociology from the London School of Economics and a PhD in Medical Sociology from King’s College London, examining the experiences of older stroke patients and their spouses using individual and joint qualitative interviews taking a biographical narrative approach. She was a researcher at King’s College London for over ten years on various studies and evaluations, including studies funded by the National Institute for Health Research and Dimbleby Cancer Care. She has worked at the University of Southampton since 2018, previously in the School of Health Sciences on a longitudinal qualitative study on people living with cancer and their carers, funded by Macmillan Cancer Support, before moving to her current role in the School of Medicine in 2022. Eloise has expertise in conducting research and evaluation using qualitative ethnographic methods with a focus on healthcare organisations and workforce, as well as patient and carer experiences. She has much experience in working with vulnerable groups including palliative care patients, bereaved carers, people with dementia, homeless people with substance misuse issues, older people living with frailty and people with chronic conditions including cancer and stroke. She has extensive experience of Public and Patient Involvement, including patients with cancer and stroke, consulting with PPI stakeholders at each stage of the research and evaluation process.
Eloise’s PhD research has been featured on the BBC Radio 4 programme ‘Thinking Allowed’ presented by Professor Laurie Taylor.
