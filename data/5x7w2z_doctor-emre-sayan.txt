Biography
Biography
Dr Sayan holds a Molecular Biology and Genetics (MBG) degree from Bogazici University (Istanbul, 1995). Then he completed his MSc. (1997) and PhD. (2002) degrees in Bilkent University (Ankara). Between 2002 and 2010, he did 3 post-doctoral trainings in France (INSERM U370, Paris) and UK (MRC Toxicology Unit, Leicester and University of Leicester, CSMM dept). Dr Sayan was appointed as a lecturer in Cancer Sciences Division at University of Southampton in 2010. His research (between 1997 and 2010) comprised the role of p53 family member proteins (p53, p63 and p73) during normal physiology and cancer development. Additionally he developed interest in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a process key to the spread of tumor cells, which is implicated in metastasis and chemo-resistance. As metastasis is the primary reason for cancer related death, identification and characterization of EMT pathways is critical for patient stratification and development of new therapies.
