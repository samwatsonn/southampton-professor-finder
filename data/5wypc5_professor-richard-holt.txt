Biography
Professor Holt’s current research interests are broadly focussed around clinical diabetes but specifically encompass studies of the relationship between mental illness and diabetes and, diabetes and pregnancy.
His clinical responsibilities include the diabetes and pregnancy clinic, young adult diabetes clinic and the cystic fibrosis related diabetes service.
Professor Holt was the Editor-in-Chief of Diabetic Medicine (2016-2020) and is a past-Chair of the Council of Health Care Professionals of Diabetes UK. Professor Holt was a member of the 2008 NICE diabetes and pregnancy guideline development group and the NICE Type 2 diabetes: preventing the progression from pre-diabetes programme development group. Professor Holt is the Editor-in-Chief of the 5th edition of the Textbook of Diabetes. Professor Holt is Vice-Chair of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Committe for Clinical Affairs and was the EASD co-chair of the EASD-ADA consensus report of the management of type 1 diabetes in adults.
