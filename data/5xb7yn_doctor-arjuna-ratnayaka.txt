Biography
Biography
Dr Ratnayaka brings together expertise in Retinal Cell Biology and Neurodegeneration. After graduating from the University of Aberdeen, Dr Ratnayaka completed a Master’s degree at Imperial College, London, followed by a PhD from the University of Liverpool. His doctoral work characterised the molecular/biochemical fate of proteins associated with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and proliferative vitreoretinopathy. He extended his interests in degenerative pathophysiology at King’s College London, and at the University of Sussex, where his postdoctoral work investigated axonal and synaptic mechanisms in the central nervous system. His group at Southampton studies the molecular mechanisms underlying degenerative processes in the senescent retina and brain. His team comprises of technical and postdoctoral staff as well as PhD students. Their work utilises in-vitro cell and animal models as well as human donor tissues, and employs techniques such as gene-editing, lentiviruses, stem cells, ultrastructural and 3D-imaging. Dr Ratnayaka’s work involves collaborations with other scientists, clinicians and with industry. He also studies the policy implications of his work. His portfolio includes supervision, teaching and mentoring across two Faculties, as well as acting as a UK/international PhD examiner. He is the Academic Lead for the Southampton Biomedical Imaging Faculty, the Head of Field for BMedSci Neuroscience projects and hosts BSc, MSc, MMedSc and BMedSci students in his laboratory. Dr Ratnayaka is involved in raising awareness of blinding diseases as well as conditions such as Alzheimer’s and dementia through public lectures, workshops and public/patient outreach activities on behalf of several research organisations. He also acts as a scientific, technical and academic expert in the advisory panels of several organisations, and as consultant to Pharma/SMEs. Dr Ratnayaka is a peer-reviewer for grant-awarding bodies (UKRI, the Wellcome Trust and other UK/international research organisation) as well as for scientific journals in his area of expertise.
