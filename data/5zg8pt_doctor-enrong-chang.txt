Biography
Biography
I completed PhD and two years’ post-doctoral research at UCL in the areas of stress analysis, fatigue assessment, fracture mechanics modelling, non-destructive testing and underwater inspection reliability analysis for tubular welded joints in offshore jacket platforms.
Since then, I have worked in the UK marine and offshore industry for twenty years. At Kvaerner Oil and Gas Ltd, I performed the finite element analyses for North Sea offshore jacket platforms and risers. As a chartered naval architecture Engineer, I had 18 years' classification society hull and statutory plan approval experiences on the design of various types of ships and offshore installations.  At American Bureau of Shipping, as a Senior engineer I carried out the design review for compliance with applicable classification society Rules and statutory legislation for all types of vessels and floating units including ultra large container ships, gas carriers, oil & chemical tankers, FPSO conversions/new builds, offshore support vessels and FLNG etc. At Lloyd’s Register, as a lead specialist I performed the analysis and design review of various marine and offshore structures and was responsible for classification appraisal of the pump tower and containment system for many LNG carriers and FLNG units built in HHI, DSME and SHI, which cover cargo tank structural strength, fatigue, sloshing, vibration, risk based inspection and survival condition assessments.
From April 2018 to June 2021, I performed the research in areas of structural integrity of natural gas and carbon dioxide CO2 transport pipelines at the University of Strathclyde for three years. During this period, I have successfully taught “Design and Construction of FPSOs”, “Advanced Marine Structures”, "Ship Structural Dynamics" and part of "Marine Engineering Fundamentals” modules to undergraduate and MSc students.
From September 2021 to June 2022, I worked on two Clean Maritime Demonstration research projects in the areas of smart and zero carbon shipping at the Newcastle university.
Qualifications:
BSc (Eng) honours in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University 1987
MSc (Eng) in Ship Structural Mechanics Shanghai Jiao Tong University 1990
PhD in Mechanical Engineering (offshore structures) University College London (UCL) 1997
Memberships:
Member of The Royal Institution of Naval Architects (MRINA)
Chartered Engineer (CEng)
Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA)
London Branch Council Member of The Royal Institution of Naval Architects
AWARD:
My paper entitled “Characteristic Parameters for Stress Distributions along the Intersection of Tubular Y, T, X and DT-Joints” has been awarded the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) Prize for the best paper published in the Journal of Strain Analysis in 2001.
