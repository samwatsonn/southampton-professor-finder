Professor Thomas Blumensath
Professor
Research interests
I develop and study advanced algorithms that can solve challenging inverse problems by efficiently exploiting complex prior information. Using techniques from mathematics, statistics and machine learning, my work concentrates primarily on problems in x-ray tomographic image reconstruction and modelling.
I work closely with state-of-the-art imaging facilities (µ-VIS, the National Research Facility in Lab-based XCT, the UK’s synchrotron facility at the Diamond Light Source, and ISIS neutron imaging beamline) to find practical solutions to a range of important scientific problems from plant science to manufacturing.
My research interests cover areas such as: Theoretical and computational methods for Signal and Image Processing (Machine Learning, Compressed Sensing, Statistical Signal and Image Processing, Quantum Computing, Inverse Problems, Optimisation, X-ray Tomographic Imaging); Advanced tomographic imaging strategies: (limited angle tomography and laminography, Spectral X-ray imaging, Stereo and extreme limited view tomography); Efficient computational methods for tomographic reconstruction, including GPU acceleration, distributed computation and advanced optimisation strategies, Constrained optimisation for ill-conditioned and underdetermined   tomographic inverse problems, Applications of X-ray tomography to the inspection of manufactured components, Multimodal tomographic imaging

Biography
Biography
Thomas received a B.Sc. (Hons) in Music Technology and Audio System Design from the University in Derby in 2002 and, in 2006, a PhD in Electronic Engineering (Bayesian Signal Processing) from the University of London. Since 2005, he held various appointments as Postdoctoral Researcher and Research Fellow working at the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London, the Institute for Digital Communications at the University of Edinburgh, the Applied Mathematics Research Group at the University of Southampton and the University of Oxford's Centre for functional MRI of the brain.
In 2012 he joined the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, where he worked as a New Frontiers Fellow, a Lecturer (since 2015) an Associate Professor (since 2017) and a Professor (since 2022).  As an engineer and mathematician, his work spans theoretical and applied aspects of Signal and Image processing, concentrating particularly on Industrial applications of computed tomography and related volumetric imaging problems.
