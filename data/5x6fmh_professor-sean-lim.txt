Biography
Sean completed her medical degree at the University of Bristol in 2001, and then trained in general medicine before specialising in Haematology, which she completed in 2012. During this time, she was awarded a clinical research training fellowship by the Medical Research Council which enabled her to simultaneously complete a PhD in cancer immunotherapy at Southampton in 2011. Her work was awarded the Royal College of Pathologists’ Specialty Research Medal (2012) and UK CLL Forum’s Catovsky Prize (2011).
Through a Cancer Research UK Clinician Scientist Fellowship award, Dr Lim spent two years as a visiting postdoctoral research fellow in Professor Ron Levy’s laboratory at Stanford University, USA. In 2015, she returned to Southampton to lead her own research group. Her recent work was awarded the British Association for Cancer Research (BACR) Roger Griffin Prize for Cancer Drug Discovery. She is also a practicing clinician subspecialising in lymphoma.
