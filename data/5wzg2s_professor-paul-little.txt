Biography
Professor Little was the first GP to be awarded a Wellcome HSR training fellowship in 1993 (for research on health promotion), and the first to be awarded an MRC Clinician Scientist Fellowship in 1998 (for research on common self-limiting illness), and in addition current major areas of research are in enabling behaviour change both for health professionals and also in empowering patients.
Professor Little received recognition in the 2018 Queenâs Birthday Honours with the award of aâ¯CBE for services to General Practice Research, in June 2019 he was awarded theâ¯RCGP Discovery Prize in recognition of his outstanding research in general practice and in November 2020 Paul was awarded The Maurice Wood Award for Lifetime Contribution to Primary Care Research.
In November 2023 Paul was named the Garrod Medallist of the year by the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.
