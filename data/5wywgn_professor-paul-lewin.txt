Biography
About
Paul L. Lewin was born in Ilford, Essex in 1964.  He received the BSc (Hons) and PhD degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Southampton, UK in 1986 and 1994, respectively.  He joined the academic staff of the University in 1989 and is Professor of Electrical Power Engineering and Head of Electronics and Computer Science, where he is also is the Director of the Tony Davies High Voltage Laboratory. His research interests are within the generic areas of applied signal processing and control.  Within high voltage engineering this includes condition monitoring of HV cables and plant, surface charge measurement, HV insulation/dielectric materials and applied signal processing.  In the area of automation he is particularly interested in the practical application of repetitive control and iterative learning control algorithms. Since 1996 he has received funding and grants in excess of £30M, supervised 45 graduate students to successful completion of their doctoral theses and published over 500 refereed conference and journal papers in these research areas.  He is a Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the IET and IEEE and was  general chair of IEEE International Conference on Solid Dielectrics 2007 and IEEE Electrical Insulation Conference 2015.  He was the 2016-17 President of the IEEE Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation Society and for many years was an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation.
In terms of the education agenda, In the early 1990s he was a member of the working group that established the BEng/MEng electromechanical engineering degree at Southampton. In more recent years he has been personally responsible for the development of an MSc in Energy and Sustainability with Electrical Power Engineering (2009) and BEng/MEng in Electronics and Electrical Engineering (2011).  He has been the External Examiner for the University of Leicester’s BEng/MEng EEE programme as well as the External Examiner for Coventry University’s MScs in control and signal processing. In 2011 he received a grant from UK HE-STEM of £150,000 to develop e-learning resources at Masters level for use by engineers in the power industry.
