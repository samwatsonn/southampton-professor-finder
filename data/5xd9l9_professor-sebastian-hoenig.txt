About
Prof Sebastian Hoenig graduated (Dipl.-Phys.) from the University of Heidelberg and received his PhD in astronomy from the University of Bonn and the Max-Planck-Institute for Radioastronomy. Following postdoctoral fellowships at the Max Planck Institute, the University of California Santa Barbara, and the University of Copenhagen, Sebastian joined the University of Southampton in 2014 as a Lecturer and Marie Curie fellow. He is now Professor of Observational & Computational Astrophysics and currently serves as Head of the Astronomy Group.
Sebastian's research focuses on dust in supermassive black holes and involves high-angular resolution observations, 3D radiative transfer modelling (CAT3D & CAT3D-WIND), radiation hydrodynamic simulations and time series analysis. His research group is supported by the European Research Council, the European Commission's Research Executive Agency, and the Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC). He is Co-I of the GRAVITY+ collaboration to deliver a high-sensitivity and wide-field upgrade for the current instrument GRAVITY at the European Southern Observatory's flagship facility in Chile. Sebastian serves as Deputy Director of the Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Intensive Science DISCnet.
