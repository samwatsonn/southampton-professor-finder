Biography
Biography
Dr Peter Worsley is Professor of Assistive Technology and Tissue Health within Health Sciences at the University of Southampton. He has a balanced academic portfolio, co-leading the Skin Health research group based in a Clinical Academic Facility, and is the deputy programme lead for BSc and MSc Physiotherapy programmes (Ranked as one of the top programmes in the UK since 2018, according to the complete university guide). His research and clinical experience has fuelled a passion for scientific understanding of key healthcare challenges. He has successfully translated bioengineering approaches and healthcare technologies to promote skin and soft tissue health. This has included in-vivo (healthy volunteers and patient studies) and in-silico research studies, funded by UKRI, NIHR, EU, industry, and charities.
His research incorporates a multidisciplinary approach including academics from UoS, the UK, and international collaborators. He is responsible for efficient functioning of state-of-the-art laboratory facilities and supervising student researchers, including PhDs, masters and internships. He is a local leader of the South Central Hub of the Council of Allied Health Professionals Research (CAHPR), participating in national strategy meetings. He has developed an international reputation in his research field, where his role include being the scientific chair of the EPUAP, member of International Standards Organisation groups (ISO/TC 173/WG11), and a member of the editorial board of Journal of Tissue Viability and Clinical Biomechanics.
He collaborates with a number of industrial partners, testing and developing medical device innovations. With colleagues in the Faculty of Engineering, he has successfully spun out a company, Radii Devices Ltd, which provides cutting edge technologies to support medical device design in prosthetics and orthotics. The company has attracted funding from both hedge fund investors and UKRI (Innovate UK).
