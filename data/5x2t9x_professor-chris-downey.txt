Biography
I think I benefitted hugely from being a late arrival to my family, as having two older sisters usually meant there was someone to read a book or play a game when my parents were either working, occupied or just needed a break.
I maintained through most of my time at school that I wasn't interested in going to University. There was no one in the family to spark my curiosity, but some quietly determined teachers sowed seeds of enquiry in my mind and a sponsored "university taster week" finally dealt with my remaining resistance. I studied Chemistry at the Univerity of London and graduated with a job in industry. After two years I did a spell of volunteer work in Austria before returning to the UK to undertake a postgraduate initial teacher education programme (PGCE) here at the University of Southampton.
Despite that choice being more one of expediency than a sense of vocation, I fell for teaching in a big way. I spent the next twelve years teaching science in two secondary schools along the south coast of England, also gaining experience of middle and senior leadership as a Head of Department and an Assistant Headteacher. I got a tremendous kick out of seeing students grapple with and conquer complex concepts. I even set some of those challenging concpets to music after recognising that singing has a remarkable way of developing memory and aiding recall. While on the job as a teacher I was studying for masters degrees through distance education with the Open University and eventually worked part time as an Associate Lecturer for the OU on UG science modules while also assessing and writing A-level exam papers for a national exam board.
In 2006 I took up an opportunity to work as a Research Assistant on a two year Knowledge Transfer Partnership project between Southampton Education School and a Local Authority Education Service on the use of data for school improvement. This formed the context for my doctoral research and in 2008 I joined the staff of Education School as a Lecturer here at the University of Southampton.
