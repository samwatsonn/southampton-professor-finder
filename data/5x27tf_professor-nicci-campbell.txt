Biography
"Cochlear implants have completely transformed the lives of those with severe and profound deafness over the past 30 years. Our multidisciplinary service, which now also offers bone conduction hearing devices/implants, supports over 1300 auditory implant users, ranging in age from less than one year to over 90 years of age. Seeing the success of our implant users is tremendously rewarding!"
Nicole (Nicci) Campbell is a Professorial Fellow (Enterprise)/Principal Audiological Scientist, based at the University of Southampton Auditory Implant Service (USAIS), an enterprise unit within Engineering and Physical Sciences.
In addition to her NHS patient caseload (primary role), Nicci is the USAIS Academic Coordinator and has also set up and is the Team Lead for both the Self-funded Cochlear Implant Service and the interdisciplinary Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) Service.
As Academic Coordinator at USAIS she oversees the teaching activities of over 50 staff members, a role created by the University following her vision to develop a close collaboration between USAIS and the Audiology Department at the University.  This win-win collaboration offers a real world 'patient' experience for students, empowers our implant users (who are invited as guest lecturers) and offers invaluable research opportunities. Her MSc AUDI 6012 Auditory Implant Module, the first of its kind in the UK, is consistently rated as excellent by students.
The Self-funded Cochlear Implant Service widens access to adults who would benefit for a cochlear implant but are not eligible for NHS funding, (e.g. just out of criteria, wanting an implant for their other ear - unlike children adults are only eligible for one implant in the UK, or in cases of single-sided deafness). The interdisciplinary APD Service, the first of its kind in the UK, offers support to those with normal hearing but difficulty processing information they hear.
Nicci has developed and oversees the popular 12-week clinical placement programme at USAIS.  Past clinical placement trainees have excelled and gone on to set up and develop cochlear implant services around the world as well as securing substantive clinical and research positions, both nationally and internationally. Countries that have benefitted from this expertise include Singapore, Saudi Arabia, China, Canada, Netherlands and Belgium. Click here to hear from our most recent trainees.
