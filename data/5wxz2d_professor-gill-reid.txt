Biography
Biography
Gill’s research focus on transition metal and main group coordination chemistry is motivated by both fundamental studies of new ligand types that explore the influence of new metal-ligand combinations on properties and reactivity, as well as more application driven targets, that include developing tailored precursor complexes for the controlled deposition of inorganic semiconductor materials for electronic and thermoelectric devices (using area selective chemical vapour deposition and electrodeposition) and new metal fluoride scaffolds for medical imaging applications.

Gill was born and raised in Scotland and studied Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh, receiving a BSc (hons) in 1986 and a PhD investigating the synthesis, structures and electrochemical properties of transition metal macrocyclic complexes in 1989. In 1991, following a two-year post-doctoral position in Edinburgh, she was appointed to a lectureship in Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Southampton, becoming Professor in 2006. After a period as Director of Research, she served as Head of Chemistry at Southampton from 2016-2020 where she oversaw a major investment and refurbishment of the original chemistry building and teaching labs. She has published >360 papers and regularly presents her group’s work at national and international conferences. She became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (FRSC) in 2012, served as an Elected Member of RSC Council (2011-15) and was elected to Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) in 2022.
She became President-Elect of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) in July 2020, prior to taking up the role of RSC President from 2022-2024.
Gill has a strong interest in education in Chemistry, outreach and public engagement. At present her teaching spans a range of topics across transition metal and main group coordination chemistry and macrocyclic chemistry, and she has served as External Examiner for UG degree programmes in several UK Chemistry Departments. She led Chemistry's Outreach Programme from 2000-10, while also leading several successful EPSRC and RSC projects in this area. She received the Vice Chancellor's Award for Teaching in Chemistry in 2006 and an RSC Award for Achievement in the Promotion of Chemistry (2007). Gill chaired the RSC Outreach Working Group (2014-2018) and co-led delivery of the ‘Taking Technology Smaller’ exhibit at the 2015 Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition, based on the EPSRC flagship Programme Grant, ‘Supercritical Fluid Electrodeposition’ (www.scfed.net).
