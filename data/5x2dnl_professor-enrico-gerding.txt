Biography
About
Dr Enrico Gerding is an Associate Professor in the Agents, Interaction and Complexity (AIC) research group in the Department of Electronics and Computer Science (ECS) at the University of Southampton. He has been an academic at Southampton since 2007. He received his PhD from the Dutch National Center of Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI) in 2004. His research focuses on artificial intelligence, specifically autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. He has more than 100 peer-reviewed publications in high quality conferences, journals and books in this area. Please see the research tab below for details. Enrico has supervised 19 PhD students to completion. He is the director of Southampton's Centre for Machine Intelligence which brings together AI expertise in ECS. Since 2020 he is a board member of the International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (IFAAMAS) which organises the annual Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS) conference. He is also local organiser of AAMAS 2021. He teaches the MSc module Intelligent Agents (see below for more details on teaching). Currently he is a co-I on several funded projects, including the EPSRC-funded AutoTrust platform grant, the Shell-funded Centre for Maritime Futures.
PhD Studentships. I'm interested in supervising motivated students, and there are plenty of opportunities for fully funded studentships. Note that most studentships only fund UK fees. So if you are an international student without permanent residance (or pre-settled) status, you may have to cover the difference between UK and international fees. For Chinese students, there are various collaborations with the CSC scholarship scheme and it's worth looking into this. Please get in touch to discuss the options and potential topics. See also my research interests below.

Current research
My main research focuses on applications where autonomous self-interested agents compete in markets and negotiate, and where designing appropriate incentives is important to ensure a well functioning and fair society. My research combines theory, mainly game theory and mechanism design, with practical applications. Specific applications include: autonomous vehicles, the smart grid, online advertising markets, cloud computing, algorithmic trading, ride sharing and data privacy.
I'm currently an investigator on the following projects:
AutoTrust: Human Centered Internet of Vehicles
This EPSRC-funded platfrom grants looks at a wide range of aspects around the Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), such as the interaction with autonomous systems (human-to-vehicle interaction), the issue of data privacy and consent, as well as the incentives and optimisation of e.g. traffic flow. Specific topics include: how do platoons form and how can they be used most effectively to improve traffic flow; how can we incentivise better use of public transport and/or shared vehicles (ride sharing); how can we best combine different modes of transport to reduce carbon emissions; how can we ensure that transportation data can be stored securely and used for research purposes; in autonomous vehicles and autonomous systems more generally, how can we reason about concepts such as responsibility and accountability especially when there is shared responsibility of a coalition (e.g. in case of a collision).
The project is a collaboration with the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG). Investigators on the project in Southampton are: prof m.c. schraefel (PI) and Dr Sebastian Stein. Researchers currently employed on the project include: Dr Vahid Yazdanpanah and Dr Richard Gomer.
Forecasting and influencing product returns and fraud rates in a Covid-19 world
This ESRC project is led by Dr Gina Frei from the Southampton Business School and is a collaboration between ECS and the business school. The aim is to look at product returns fraud which has been aggravated due to COVID 19. Many retailers are faced with this issue. The project will consider different interventions to reduce fraud and analyse through a combination of interview studies and agent-based modelling.
Shell Centre for Maritime Futures
This collaboration between Shell Shipping, ECS and Engineering aims to reduce carbon emissions in shipping. The ECS team is building an agent-based simulation platform to simulate trades and shipping routes, which can be used to find the most cost effective CO2 reduction measures over a long-term (5-20 years) time horizon.

COMP6203 Intelligent Agents
This module gives a broad introduction to the new and rapidly expanding field of agent-based computing. It introduces the key concepts and models of the field, dealing both with the individual agents and with their interactions. Particular emphasis is placed on automated negotiation, cooperation and on-line auctions, and students are required to program a trading agent in Java which will compete in a class tournament within a simulated trading environment. Main topics include: agent-based negotiation, game theory, auctions, voting, preference elicitation and cooperative games.
COMP3208 Social Computing Techniques
This module is about using online collective intelligence or the wisdom of the crowd in various business and research applications and the underlying technologies and algorithms that are used in practice. The main topics covered include: Crowdsourcing, Recommender Systems, Reputation Systems, Experimental Design and Web Analytics, Online Advertising Auctions and Rank Aggregation.
