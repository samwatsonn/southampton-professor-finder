Biography
Biography
Ken completed his Ph.D. in social/personality psychology at the Centre for Research in Self and Identity, University of Southampton, in March 2015. He joined the Clinical Informatics Research Unit, Faculty of Medicine, as a Research Fellow soon after. Ken's Ph.D. research focused on the experience and the functions of nostalgia with regards to individual differences (resilience) in response to psychological threats (loneliness).
