Biography
Biography
Tahrima joined the University in November 2022.Before joining the team she worked as a Research officer for the Research on Improving Systems of Education (RISE) team at Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford. The global research endeavour seek to evaluate how education systems in developing countries can overcome the learning crisis.
Tahrima's unique background, marked by international experiences, has shaped her expertise in education research, international collaboration, and large-scale evaluation. Having grown up in a developing country and having worn multiple hats as a teacher, teacher trainer, and education researcher in various developing nations, she possesses the invaluable ability to view educational challenges from both within and outside the context, making her a valuable asset to large-scale education projects.
She also has experience working with several Russel Group English universities, which has deepened her understanding of how education system works in HE. Her dedication to improving educational systems and fostering sustainable impact goes beyond research. She actively engages in the crucial work of evidencing and evaluating the transformative impact of education. Tahrima is also a member of the UK Evaluation Society, a distinguished Teach For All Alumni, and a former Chevening Scholar.
