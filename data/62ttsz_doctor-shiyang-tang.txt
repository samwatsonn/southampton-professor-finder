Biography
About
Dr. Shiyang Tang is an Associate Professor in the School of Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton, UK. He received his BEng (1st-class honours) in Electrical Engineering and PhD in Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT University), Australia, in 2012 and 2015, respectively. He went to the Pennsylvania State University and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) to conduct his postdoctoral research in bio-microfluidics. He was the Vice-Chancellor's Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Wollongong, Australia, from 2017 to 2019. Before joining the University of Southampton, he was a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the School of Engineering at the University of Birmingham, UK. Dr. Tang is the recipient of the Future Fellowship and the Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) from the Australian Research Council. Dr. Tang has published ~110 papers in high-impact journals, including PNAS, Nature Communications, Science Advances, Matter, and Advanced Materials. Dr. Tang is the Associate Editor of the Journal of Nanobiotechnology (2022 IF: 10.2) and Nonlinear Engineering (2022 IF: 8.3), and an Editorial Board member of Sensors, Scientific Reports, and Soft Science.

Current research
Our primary focus is exploring and developing soft intelligent systems for biomedical applications.  We are interested in interdisciplinary problems that involve microfluidics, smart materials, electromechanical systems, machine learning, electronics, and micro-/nanotechnologies. We aspire to engineer useful devices through the investigation of the fundamental properties of materials. Please see Dr Tang's Soft Intelligent Systems group website and Google Scholar for details.
