About
Professor Harold Chong is a member of Sustainable Electronic Technologies Group in the School of Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton. He is leading the research in thin film electronic and photonic devices technology using atomic layer deposition and hot-wire chemical vapour deposition method. His work has led to the lowest optical loss amorphous silicon material platform for multi-layer photonic circuits and novel development of oxide semiconductor nanowire electronics for environmental sensing and RF integrated circuits. Professor Chong has published more than 160 journal and conference papers in the areas of semiconductor nanowire electronic devices, Micro-Electro-Mechanical System, multi-layer photonic integrated circuits and microfabrication technology. Besides reserach, he lectures in the subject of semiconductor devices, electronics and microfabrication to undergraduate and postgraduate students. He is a visiting Professor at Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.
