Biography
John McBride is an Engineering Professor at the University of Southampton.
Previously 2009-2017, the founder and CEO of the University of Southampton Malaysia (UoSM); where he delivered the University’s first international campus from an idea to a fully functioning campus. During 2010-2012, he was Associate Dean for Research in the Faculty of Engineering and the Environment; and from 2018 the head of the Mechatronics research group.
He is an expert on electrical contact physics, nanomaterials and optical/X-ray metrology; he has published over 300 papers, 3 patents, and is an associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging and Manufacturing Technology (CPMT).
As Principle Investigator, (PI) he has completed research projects in excess of £8 Million and graduated 28 Ph.D students. He has chaired sessions, acted on the organising committees, been technical chair and international chair of international conferences. In 2006 he was awarded the IEEE Holm Scientific Achievement Award, an international award recognising outstanding scientists and engineers in the field of electric contacts or related technologies. In 2008 he was awarded the international James A. Lindner Prize for research on early sound recording. In 2015 and in 2021 he co-authored the Best Paper, IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology.
His research has led to the development of a number of spinout companies, these include 2 optical Metrology companies. In 2001 he established TaiCaan Technologies Ltd, a world leader in optical surface metrology. In 2021 the company worked closely with the NHS to develop Saliva sampling methods for COVID testing.
