Biography
Biography
Professor Donna Davies (nee Harrison) was awarded a Personal Chair in Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology in 2004. She graduated with a first class degree in Biochemistry from the University of Wales and completed her PhD in microbial biochemistry in 1979. She started her post-doctoral studies at the University of Oxford investigating the regulation of insulin secretion and continued this work following the award of an RD Lawrence Fellowship from the British Diabetic Association in 1982. She moved to the CRC Wessex Medical Oncology Unit at the University of Southampton in 1985, before she joined the Respiratory Group through the award of a University of Southampton Senior Research Fellowship in 1998 and then a Readership in 2002.  In 2014, she received the Robert A. Cooke Memorial Medal from the American Academy Of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. She is a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (since 2014), a Fellow of the European Respiratory Society (since 2015) and in 2020 received lifetime membership of the British Association for Lung Research in recognition of her contribution to the BALR and lung research.
