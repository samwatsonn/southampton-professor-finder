Emeritus Professor Stephen Elliott
Research interests
Professor Elliott's research interests have been mainly concerned with the connections between the physical world and digital signal processing.
The research was originally related to the active control of sound and vibration. This work has resulted in the demonstration of active control in cars, helicopters and propeller aircraft and the authorship of the books "Active Control of Sound" with P.A. Nelson, "Active Control of Vibration" with C.R. Fuller and P.A. Nelson and, most recently, "Signal Processing for Active Control".The active control research has traditionally involved the reduction of unwanted noise, most recently on luxury yachts, but has recently developed to the reproduction of sound signals, such as music, in specific regions of space, so that, for example, the driver of a car can listen to Radio 4, while a child in the back of the car can listen to a Disney DVD.He is also involved in working on the growing body of work on modelling the mechanics of the cochlea and the functioning of cochlear implants, as below. This is important not only for communication and speech processing systems, but also in order to help understand the causes of hearing impairment and how they might be overcome.

Biography
Professor Steve Elliott is a Professor at the ISVR, in Engineering and Physical Sciences at the University of Southampton.
He graduated with joint honours in physics and electronics from the University of London in 1976 and in 1979 was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Surrey for a thesis on musical acoustics. After his appointment as a lecturer at the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR) in 1982, he was made senior lecturer in 1988 and Professor of Adaptive Systems in 1994.
He served as Director of the ISVR from 2005 to 2010
My research has been concerned with the connections between the physical world, signal processing and control, mostly in relation the active control of sound and vibration. This work has resulted in the practical demonstration of active control in propeller aircraft, cars and helicopters. My current research interests include personal and zonal audio and modelling the active processes within the cochlear
Professor Elliott has published over 250 papers in refereed journals and 600 conference papers and is co-author of Active Control of Sound (with P A Nelson 1992), Active Control of Vibration (with C R Fuller and P A Nelson 1996) and author of Signal Processing for Active Control (2001).
He was made a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2009.
