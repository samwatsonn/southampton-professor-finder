Biography
I have a longstanding interest in empowering patients and people in the community to take control over their health and treatment. My current programme of research addresses key questions concerning how to maximise engagement with digital interventions and how best to integrate digital support for self-management of health with healthcare services. I am addressing these questions through the development and evaluation of numerous web-based healthcare interventions funded by over £50 million from the UK research councils, NIHR, medical charities and EC. These include interventions to support weight management, physical activity, reduction of infection transmission and antibiotic over-use, and self-management of numerous long-term health conditions (including cancer, hypertension, diabetes, back pain, asthma, cognitive decline and many other health problems). Through this work I have pioneered the widely used ‘Person-Based Approach’ (see www.personbasedapproach.org) to using mixed methods for intervention development, which has resulted in very effective interventions published in journals such as the Lancet, BMJ and Annals of Internal Medicine.
