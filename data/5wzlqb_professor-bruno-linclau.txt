Biography
Biography
Professor Bruno Linclau was appointed into his current position in August 2015 as Professor of Organic Chemistry.
Bruno Linclau graduated from the University of Ghent, Belgium in 1992. His undergraduate thesis was carried out at Leicester University as an ERASMUS exchange student with Dr P R Jenkins during his final year. Back in Ghent, he joined the group of Professor M Vandewalle for his PhD (1992 - 1996, funded by the Belgian "National Fund of Scientific Research"), where he completed the total synthesis of several Vitamin D analogues. This was followed by a postdoctoral stay with Professor D P Curran in Pittsburgh PA (USA) (1997 - 1999), with a fellowship from the "Belgian American Educational Foundation" and from the University of Pittsburgh. There he worked on fluorous chemistry applications in combinatorial chemistry and developed a fluorous scavenger approach illustrated with automated solution phase parallel synthesis of urea libraries. He joined the Chemistry at Southampton University as a lecturer in August 1999, followed by a promotion to Senior Lecturer in 2005, to Reader in 2013, and to Professor in 2015. In October 2021, he moved to Ghent University as a Senior Full Professor in Organic Chemistry, but he retains a dual appointment in Southampton.
He is a member of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) Carbohydrate Subject Group Committee, and is secretary of the RSC Fluorine Subject Group Committee. He is also a regular member of the American Chemical Society (ACS).
