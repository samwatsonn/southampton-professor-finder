Biography
Biography
Graham Roberts qualified in Medicine from the University of Oxford. He under took his paediatric training in Leeds and London. He completed a 4 year clinical research fellowship in paediatric allergy and respiratory medicine at Imperial College School of Medicine at St Mary’s in Professor Gideon Lack’s group. Graham Roberts was awarded a MSc in Epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He completed his doctoral thesis on the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy for childhood allergic asthma. His other research interests included exhaled nitric oxide, quality of life in allergic disease, severe childhood asthma, improving the diagnosis and management of childhood food allergy and, in collaboration with the ALSPAC study, the epidemiology of childhood aeroallergen, food and latex allergy. Graham Roberts completed his training in paediatric respiratory medicine at The London Hospital and the Royal Brompton Hospital. Graham Roberts took up an appointment as a clinical senior lecturer in paediatric allergy and respiratory medicine in October 2004. He was promoted to Reader in 2007 and to Professor in 2011. He is also the Co- Director of the David Hide Asthma and Allergy Research Centre on the Isle of Wight. He is a member of the Executive Committee of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and, until June 2014, was Chair of the Paediatric Section.  He is Editor-in-Chief of the journal Clinical and Experimental Allergy (impact factor 4.769).
Graham Roberts’s has a translational epidemiological research programme. It focuses on the pathogenesis and natural history of childhood asthma and food allergy together with the development of new strategies to improve the management of asthma. This involves studies in Southampton, at the David Hide Asthma and Allergy Research Centre in the Isle of Wight and in collaboration with colleagues at the Evelina Children’s Hospital, St Thomas’s Hospital, London.
Graham Roberts works clinically within the Southampton University Hospital NHS Trust as a paediatrician specialising in allergy and respiratory medicine. Additionally he oversees the undergraduate child health teaching programme.
