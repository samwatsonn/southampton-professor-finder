Dr Kelvin Peh
Associate Professor
Research interests
Kelvin Peh’s interests range from forest ecology to urban wildlife in respect of diversity and distribution. He is interested in all areas of wildlife-human conflicts and wildlife ecology in human-dominated landscapes, and in the application of his research results to the conservation/management of biological resources.
Tropical Forest Ecology – Kelvin’s work on monodominance in tropical tree-dominated systems - has helped rekindle scientific interest in this fascinating, yet relatively unexplored phenomenon in tropical forests. He has completed editing – as a principal editor – a “Routledge Handbook of Forest Ecology” that was published by Routledge under its “Earthscan” imprint. Currently, he is working on the 2nd edition of this handbook.
Ecosystem Services – Kelvin is best known for his leading role in the development of TESSA (Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment). TESSA v3.0, published on 31 Oct 2022, is now available at http://tessa.tools/. He continues working on this ecosystem service assessment project to develop and test novel tools for rapidly assessing the net impact of site-based conservation on the provision of ecosystem services. This project runs in collaboration with the University of Cambridge, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, BirdLife International, Tropical Biology Association, Anglia Ruskin University and UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre.

Biodiversity and Conservation – Kelvin has a strong interest in topics such as invasive alien species and environmental governance. Also he proposes to continue developing the theme of diversity-functioning relationship in the tropics. He plans to initiate new projects that involve large spatial data sets, in Southeast Asia and central Africa where issues such as species habitat loss and environmental degradation are becoming very pressing. His future research plans also include initiating a project to investigate the environmental impact of China’s involvement in Africa. The purpose of this project is to analyse not the political or developmental implications of China’s policies, but their ecological and social-economic consequences on Africa.

Biography
Biography
Dr Kelvin Peh joined Biological Sciences and the Institute for Life Sciences in February 2013 as a Research Career Track Lecturer. He is currently a Lecturer in Conservation Science.
Having spent most of his career pursuing his life-long interest in conservation ecology–mostly in the tropics, Dr Peh’s education benefitted from the direct input and experience of top academics from the National University of Singapore, the Swedish Biodiversity Centre, Leeds University, and Cambridge University. Now at the faculty, he takes a particular pleasure in one aspect of academic life: mentoring research students. And he hopes to give them the same wide, if speedy, grounding that covers a broad range of conservation science.
