Biography
Jim began his research career by applying GIS techniques to forest management, before moving on to explore geospatial aspects of public health nutrition and food systems in Zimbabwe for his PhD.  Since moving to Southampton, he has coordinated multi-disciplinary projects funded by the European Union, NERC, MRC, ESRC, and the Royal Society, collaborating closely with colleagues in Ghana and Kenya in doing so.
