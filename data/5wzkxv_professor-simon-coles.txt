Biography
Biography
Simon obtained his BSc and PhD in structural systematics and molecular modelling at the University of Wales, Cardiff in 1992 and 1997 respectively. He held a Postdoctoral appointment with the Royal Institution, but based at the CCLRC Daresbury Laboratory, where he helped build the highly successful, world's first synchrotron Small Molecule Single Crystal beamline, 9.8. In 1998 Simon moved to Southampton to establish a new laboratory and manage the National Crystallography Service. Simon transferred to Chemistry staff in July 2009, when he took over the role of Director of the National Crystallography Service. He also became the Director of the UK Physical Sciences Data-science Service in 2019, and lead on the Physical Sciences Data Infrastructure in 2021.
